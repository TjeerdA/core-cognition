# This file contains some observations


General
- Yaml-text is not interpreted as markdown (and can have no links or other markup)

Home page
[ ] Second section has no image (feature?). I think i like images per section.

Basic section
- I have the basic section (all sections) organized in directories per page. The cover images do not show up in the basics section. They do show up as little images at the top of the post.
- Different categories at the top need a comma or other way to separate them.
- What is the role of title (in Yaml)?
- The entries are ordered: they need a weight in the Yaml.
- The tags (Kruger Dunning) at the top have no relation to the tags of the page.

Diverse:
- What does dataID with a random number in the Yaml mean? Can we get rid of it or make it meaningful?  
- It would be good to be able to suppress the TOC on some pages where it is empty.  
- I need a /pdf or /files directory for files to be shared. Not sure where to put in the tree. It in now in /content/English/pdf
- Is it possible to have multiple css-variants and to indicate via config.toml which variant is to be used? I can then use one as a "default" and play with the other variants.
- My pages are very long. IS it possible to keep the nav bar always on top of the page?
- Where can I influence the size (mainly height and font) of the different parts of the page. For example I would like to make the nav- and the title-bar more compact.
- The breadcrumbs are not links. More useful if they are.
- The markdown texts ignore <br> (line break tag). Not sure why (is not what I'm used to)

slider
- If I put the slider images in the slider folder they do not show up. I like to combine the text and associated images in the same directory
