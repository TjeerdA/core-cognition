Successful interactions with the world require realistic expectations about the world.

* The role of realistic expectations

  * If your expectations about the world are wrong: the world will prove you wrong and you will be faced with the consequences of your erroneous expect
* Role of the media:

  * Worse than mainstream media reflects very low realism
  * Mainstream media is for a mainstream audience and it is usually not very respectful towards the highest possible quality information
  * Better than mainstream media is highly respectful of the best possible information available
* Worldview:

  * Pathological worldview: you create your own problems (coping trap)
  * Normal worldview: you create as many problems as you solve (a combination of coping and co-creation )
  * Healthy worldview: you prevent and solve more problems than you create (mostly co-creation in combination with effective coping)
