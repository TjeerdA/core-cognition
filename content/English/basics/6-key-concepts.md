  summary: Text based on Andringa & Denham (2021a). The environment from which
    agents can derive all they need to survive (and thrive) and to which they
    contribute to ensure long-term viability (of self and others), Note that we
    use the term habitat to include other agents, but to exclude the agent.

| Behavior               | Agent-initiated and context-appropriate activities with expected future utility that counteract life’s precariousness and maximizes agent and habitat viability.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Coping and co-creation | Two complementary forms of cognition. Coping is in the service of continued existence and flourishing in the service of flourishing. (These two forms of cognition are opposed in the [two ontologies tabel](https://corecognition.com/basics/cc-two-ontologies/)                                                                                        |

| Habitat                | The environment from which agents can derive all they need to survive (and thrive) and to which they contribute to ensure long-term viability (of self and others), Note that we use the term habitat to include other agents, but to exclude the agent. Hence, we can speak of agent + habitat to refer to the whole of existence relevant to the agent |
| Habitat viability      | A measure of the degree to which the habitat can satisfy the conditions for agentic existence (i.e., satisfies its needs)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Biosphere              | The sumtotal of all agentic traces left in the environment. Since the biosphere grew from fragile and small, to robust and extensive we can conclude that life is a net constructive force and co-creation has been dominant                                                                                                                             |
| Carrying capacity      | A measure of the sum-total of the life activities that a habitat can sustain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Original perspective   | A perspective on the world originating as the yet undeveloped ability to separate individual viability from the combined viability of self and habitat, which allowed primitive life to optimize the whole, while addressing selfish needs and creating the conditions for more agentic life                                                             |
| Purpose of life        | The (Emergent) purpose of life is to produce more life                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Well-being             | Process of co-creation leading to high viability agents, increased habitat viability, and long-term protection of the conditions on which existence depends. Note that this is a process, not a state or the evaluation of a state.                                                                                                                      |

| Behavioral repertoire  | The set of all context-appropriate behaviors the agent has access to. Appraisal activates context appropriate subsets of the repertoire                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Learning               | The process to extend the behavioral repertoire and tune the effectivity of individual behaviors to the context                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Worldview              | The set of all that an agent takes as reliable (true) enough to base behavior on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Appraisal              | A worldview-based motivational response to the perceived viability consequences of the present that activates context appropriate behavioral options                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Core affect            | Mood level action readiness based on the appraisal of indicators of (un)safety and situationally appropriate activation of behaviors, expressed as motivations to avoid or end (coping) or motivations to perpetuate or to aim for (co-creation).                                                                                                        |
| Resilience             | “The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks” (Walker et al., 2004)                                                                                                                                                    |
