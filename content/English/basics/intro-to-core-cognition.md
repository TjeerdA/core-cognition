### What is core cognition?

Core Cognition is the cognition shared by all of life. Core Cognition describes the basic decision making structures that allowed living agents to grow a biosphere from small and fragile to extensive, robust, incredibly diverse, and highly efficient. Core cognition describes the processes of behavior selection for **survival** and **thriving**, which is something that is relevant for all of living individuals: from bacteria to humans. But cognition for flourishing – coping – is essentially different from the cognition for survival – co-creation. This website addressed the power and consequences of this basic distinction and we argue that also human cognition (psychology) manifests core cognition in all its key properties.

**Update:** The first part of [mass formation](/analyses/mass-formation) serves as a more concise introduction to core cognition. This text is yet another application of core cognition.  

The 4 texts in this section are based on a recent paper (Andringa & Denham, 2021) in which we describe the basics of **core cognition** starting from the demands to being and remaining alive and maximizing viability of self and habitat. In it we derive core cognition and its two main modes, coping and co-creation, from first principles. We apply this by explaining the structure of personality and by explaining why two completely different approaches to social well-being can emerge. 

With this text come two summary tables:

1. A [list of key concepts](/basics/6-key-concepts/)
2. [Two contrasting ontologies](/basics/7-two-contrasting-ontologies) one associated with coping, a second with co-creation
