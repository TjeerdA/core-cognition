<center> The Core Cognition website is a project dedicated to study the scientific and societal impact of core cognition; the cognition shared by all of life. Its purpose is to empower
you with broad scientific insights that help you understand
yourself, others, society, and in general the biosphere </center>

# How to find information on this website:

The basics of core cognition is outlined in two section. Section 1 addresses how [core cognition arises from the demands of life](/basics/relation-to-life/). Section 2 addresses the [key properties of coping and co-creation](/basics/coping-and-co-creation/) that emerge as two modes of being.

We apply this on the level of the human individual in the [section on identity](/basics/identity/) and the section on the societal impact of the two mode of core cognition: [two routes to general well-being](/basics/two-routes-to-general-well-being/)

We will add more and more [analyses](/analyses/) and [blogs](/blog/) in due time.
