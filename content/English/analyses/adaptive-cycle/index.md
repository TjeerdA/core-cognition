seoTitle: "The adaptive cycle, how a core concept in evolution is relevant for human civilization"
seoDescription : "The adaptive cycle is a concept from ecology to understand how complex living system evolve. Societies are also complex and the adaptive cycle helps to understand how they originate, stabilize and grow, reach a peak, and then collapse.
s a highly useful conceptual tool to understand how Life learns to build a sustainable foundation for more and more advanced Life. We derive it in a novel way."

Mini lecture on origin of the adaptive cycle (a construct developed in ecology). This video played a role in the Systems View on Life course at the University of Groningen.

The [adaptive cycle](https://www.resalliance.org/adaptive-cycle) is a very useful conceptual tool. Note that we have flipped the horizontal axis (referred to as connecteness) compared to the normal presentation. In a core cognition framework connecteness refers to low viability (stasis compared to vibrancy).

The explanation we give for the origin of the adpative cycle -- as a multi-facetted consolidation process of sustainable building blocks -- is new as far as we know.

Video topics

* The rule of adaptive change: the building blocks of life are sustainable and super stable throuhout evolution.
* Evolution is a step-wise progression of added sustainable building blocks
* Agents clearly build the biosphere, but combining agency is actually difficult and not often sustainable.
* Life consolidated itself. Actually the different meanings of consolidation covers what life needed to do to â€˜consolidate itself.
* The adaptive cycle exemplifies how life learned to discover sufficiently sustainable building blocks. Collapse, leading to a purge of the unsustainable, is part of this process.
* The adaptive cycles involve: Stabilization, improvement, integration and fortification (all meanings of the term consolidation).
* The adaptive cycle can be linked to the structure of values
* We end with a comparison of expressed values of two countries that suggest quite different cycle positions.

Another way to apply the idea of the adaptive cylce to our current situation is exemplified in this [blog by Richard Heinberg](https://richardheinberg.com/museletter-319-the-big-picture). Here he summarizes (flipped left-right) the same ideas as presented in the video:
