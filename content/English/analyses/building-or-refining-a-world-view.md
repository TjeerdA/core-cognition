  title: Building or refining a world view
  description: Irrespective of the mode you are in on a certain topic, it is
    useful to be able to judge whether show show the characteristic of builders
    or refiners. Typically thinkers who have developed a stable basis in some
    domain (or for life in general, associated with an achieved identity
    structure) and have become proficient in the refinement mode communicate
    quite differently from those who are still building their world views.

Irrespective of the mode you are in on a certain topic, it is useful to be able to judge whether show show the characteristic of builders or refiners. Typically thinkers who have developed a stable basis in some domain (or for life in general, associated with an achieved identity structure) and have become proficient in the refinement mode communicate quite differently from those who are still building their world views.

| **Builders**                                                                  | **Issue**                                    | **Refiners**                                                                 |

| Only superficially correct and complete, in detail imprecise and unclear.     | **Formulation when inspected in detail**     | Precise and clear, with a focus on what is empowering or not yet understood  |
| Muddled or superficial (not yet mastery of the domain)                        | **Internal logic, when inspected in detail** | Logical and deeply embedded in a broad knowledge base (mastery)              |
| Ideological or echo-chamber citing mostly itself (uninformed by outgroups)    | **Source origins**                           | Well- and broadly sourced irrespective the origin (and its credentials).     |
| Standard and easily repetitive.                                               | **Narrative structure**                      | Well-structured and progressively more detailed                              |
| Blanket certainty of own knowledge (Kruger Dunning effect)                    | **Confidence**                               | Certain of a well-developed core, but nuanced in the application of the core |
| Forceful, (seemingly) complete and self-contained, convincing. Easy to follow | **Presentation**                             | Nuanced, precise, complex, demanding attention to detail                     |
| Responds with talking points and various receptions of the same               | **On questions**                             | Responds with precision, typically by providing a new perspective            |
| Might be parroting ingroup consensus or authoritative narratives              | **Narrative origins**                        | Self-generated narrative with unique points of view                          |
| Aims to explain and/or convince others and self                               | **Aim**                                      | Aims to make others understand (convincing plays a minor role)               |
| Dismissive, defensive, offended. Straw manning other opinions                 | **Attitude towards deviant opinions**        | Respectful, interested. Steel manning other opinions                         |

It makes sense to treat them differently as sources of information if you aspire to become more of a refined thinker. Maybe the following picture can help.

### Transition zone

What happens when you are on the transition between building and refinement? Usually this is a gradual competence growing process that occurs almost imperceptible. One changes from a novice in the field to someone with genuine expertise and experience.[^3] Gradually you rely less and less on shared and publicly endorsed content (agreements, Knowledge 1.0) while you develop your own unique and solidly grounded perspective on the domain (grounded knowledge, Knowledge 2.0).

But this lack of awareness changes when you are confronted with information indicative of conflict between shared and publicly endorsed knowledge (associated with the &quot;vocal&quot; left hemisphere) and your developing individual viewpoint and expertise (associated with the &quot;less vocal&quot; right hemisphere). This leads to conflict between two ways of making sense of the world. Which in turn leads to a strong urge to resolve the conflict in the absence of a clear understanding of the issue: a state of confusion[^4].

Because the general direction of competence development is towards an ever more solid underpinning of one&#39;s world view two things can happen:

1. The shared and publicly endorsed version is accepted and the conflict is resolved by discounting the contribution of your own (developing viewpoint). This is associated with the normative identity style (see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LZFbQ6NUZ5L4EWzq1QBAaQXPRIGWmyGWLYv9OPjqq9s/edit?usp=sharing) page 16)
2. The information is use to refine and adjust and hence further develop one&#39;s unique viewpoint and expertise at the cost of adapting the shared and publicly endorsed knowledge. This in associated the informational identity style (see [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LZFbQ6NUZ5L4EWzq1QBAaQXPRIGWmyGWLYv9OPjqq9s/edit?usp=sharing) page 14).

[^3]: This is associated with the progression: 1) unconscious incompetence, 2) conscious incompetence, 3) conscious competence, and 4) unconscious competence. Where step 2 and 3 are associated with the vocal LH and step 4 with the less vocal RH. (McGilchrist, 2010)
