  summary: Mini lecture on origin of the adaptive cycle (a construct developed in
    ecology). The explanation we give for the origin of the adpative cycle – as
    a multi-facetted consolidation process of sustainable building blocks – is
    new as far as we know.

  title: The adaptive cycle
  description: >-
    The adaptive cycle is a very useful conceptual tool. Note that we have
    flipped the horizontal axis (referred to as connecteness) compared to the
    normal presentation. In a core cognition framework connecteness refers to
    low viability (stasis compared to vibrancy).

    The explanation we give for the origin of the adpative cycle – as a multi-facetted consolidation process of sustainable building blocks – is new as far as we know.

Mini lecture on origin of the adaptive cycle (a construct developed in ecology). This video played a role in the Systems View on Life course at the University of Groningen.

The [adaptive cycle](https://www.resalliance.org/adaptive-cycle) is a very useful conceptual tool. Note that we have flipped the horizontal axis (referred to as connecteness) compared to the normal presentation. In a core cognition framework connecteness refers to low viability (stasis compared to vibrancy).

The explanation we give for the origin of the adpative cycle – as a multi-facetted consolidation process of sustainable building blocks – is new as far as we know.

Video topics

* The rule of adaptive change: the building blocks of life are sustainable and super stable throuhout evolution.
* Evolution is a step-wise progression of added sustainable building blocks
* Agents clearly build the biosphere, but combining agency is actually difficult and not often sustainable.
* Life consolidated itself. Actually the different meanings of consolidation covers what life needed to do to ‘consolidate itself.
* The adaptive cycle exemplifies how life learned to discover sufficiently sustainable building blocks. Collapse, leading to a purge of the unsustainable, is part of this process.
* The adaptive cycles involve: Stabilization, improvement, integration and fortification (all meanings of the term consolidation).
* The adaptive cycle can be linked to the structure of values
* We end with a comparison of expressed values of two countries that suggest quite different cycle positions.
