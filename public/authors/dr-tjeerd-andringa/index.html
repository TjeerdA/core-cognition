<h2 id="mass-formation-from-first-principles">Mass formation from first principles</h2>
<p>In this presentation we derive the features of mass formation and the associated mass cognition from basic features of life. We do this from the theoretical perspective of <strong>core cognition</strong>: the hypothesized cognition shared by all of life.</p>
<p>Core cognition describes the basic requirements for the <strong>selection of situationally appropriate behavior</strong>. Selecting situationally appropriate behavior is what all living agents do, all the time.</p>
<p>And because individuals differ in <strong>state, skills, and context</strong> and they influence both each other and the <strong>habitat</strong> via their behaviors. Behavior selection is a continual process unique for each agent.</p>
<p>In this presentation we oppose two modes of being &ndash; <strong>coping an co-creation</strong> &ndash; as a caricature of the actual continual and mostly constructive, interplay between these modes.</p>
<p>However, mass formation emerges as a habitat wide <strong>dominance</strong> of coping through the suppression of co-creation in situations were agents are <strong>inadequate and respond by curtailing difference</strong>. In this extreme, it makes sense to temporarily dispense of nuance.</p>
<p>Coping and co-creation are balancing like yin and yang. Co-creation promotes <strong>diversity, complexity, novelty, and connectedness</strong>. Coping balances this by providing <strong>structure, predictability, utility, and focus</strong>. A productive interplay keeps the habitat vibrant and stable and allows its inhabitants to develop the skills to flourish.</p>
<p>This presentation focuses on when habitat complexity exceeds the coping capacity of most inhabitants. We start with some basics of core cognition.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/cc-two-modes.png" alt="two-modes.png"></p>
<h2 id="core-cognition">Core Cognition</h2>
<p>Life can be described as <strong>&ldquo;being by doing&rdquo;</strong>: (living) agents exists because they act in ways that allow them to avoid <strong>danger</strong>, <strong>low viability</strong>, and <strong>death</strong>. Individuals always aim to be and remain as <strong>safe</strong> and <strong>viable</strong> (far from death) as possible. They strive to be and remain well.</p>
<p>Cognition for <strong>survival and problem solving</strong> differs from cognition for <strong>flourishing and problem prevention</strong>. Cognition for survival and problem solving has a particular end-state: a threat that has been dealt with or a problem solved. Cognition for flourishing and problem prevention does not have particular end-states and ideally continues indefinitely as a goalless progression of favorable states<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We call cognition for survival and problem solving &ldquo;<strong>coping</strong>&rdquo; and cognition for flourishing and problem prevention &ldquo;<strong>co-creation</strong>&rdquo;. In case of <strong>life success</strong>, co-creation is the default and coping is only a temporary fallback mode intended to restore <strong>safety</strong> after co-creation failed.</p>
<p>We refer to <strong>co-creation adequacy</strong> if the agent <strong>succeeds</strong> in preventing most problems. It exhibits <strong>coping adequacy</strong> if it <strong>solves</strong> problems quickly and effectively.</p>
<p>Conversely <strong>co-creation inadequacy</strong> entails that agents are instrumental in creating their own problems states. And <strong>coping inadequacy</strong> if agents  <strong>fail</strong> to end problems effectively.</p>
<p>In particular, if the coping mode of behavior leads to more or new problems or continued <strong>danger</strong>, it remains activated: a <strong>coping trap</strong>, where coping has become the default. Individuals in this state may never learn to become adequate  co-creators. Life success entails that co-creation became the default mode of cognition.</p>
<p>Living agents learn a lot from copying the behaviors of others. But to become <strong>fully autonomous</strong> <strong>self-directors</strong> they need to overcome the limits of <strong>social mimicry</strong> and follow the lead of others by learning to trust their own decision-making; until that time they exhibit <strong>bounded autonomy</strong>. Development from bounded autonomy to full autonomy is central to successful identity development.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/cc-lifes-demands.svg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="cognition-from-first-principles">Cognition from first principles</h2>
<p>To remain alive agents must protect their viability by <strong>satisfying basic needs</strong>. But they must also contribute to the viability of their habitat, because all life depends on habitat resources to satisfy short and long term needs.</p>
<p>A <strong>surviving</strong> agent copes with pressing problems to protect its viability and generally takes more from its environment than it contributes. This is characteristic of <strong>coping</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>thriving</strong> agent contributes to a habitat in which pressing problems can mostly be avoided and <strong>habitat viability is maximized</strong>. This is a key feature of <strong>co-creation</strong>.</p>
<p>Dominant co-creation drove and drives the development of the biosphere. Conversely, dominant coping degrades the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Living agency</strong>, or agency for short, is the ability to self-maintain existence. Agency manifests itself as bringing the co-dependance of self on the habitat in the service of self and the habitat. This naturally leads to a network of mutual dependency comprising of all in the habitat.</p>
<p>In a self-stabilizing habitat, agents mostly express unforced self-initiated natural behavior that minimizes the occurrence of conflict and problems, and that stabilizes the habitat without ever aiming for particular stable states. Forests and human friendships express this dynamic.</p>
<p>Co-creation and coping successes are both the result of skilled behavior. Skilled co-creation entails furnishing the habitat with  <strong>broadly constructive traces</strong> in a process called <strong>stigmergy</strong>.</p>
<p>Skilled coping entails the quick and effective resolution of problem states and it also provides the stable structure to benefit optimally from stigmergy.</p>
<p>In isolation, coping tends to utilize and <strong>exploit</strong> the (stigmergic) resources more than it builds them.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/cc-skill-understanding-autonomy.png" alt="Understanding and autonomy"></p>
<h2 id="skill-autonomy--understanding">Skill, autonomy &amp; understanding</h2>
<p>Behavior is <strong>skilled</strong> when the outcomes of an agent&rsquo;s activities realize intended benefits. Unskilled behavior realizes unintended outcomes: the agent wastes energy or the behaviors cause harm to self or others.</p>
<p>Skilled agents can predict the pattern of outcomes of their agency and select course of actions with likely favorable outcomes This proves they <strong>understand</strong> what they are doing.</p>
<p>Unskilled agents are ineffective and might produce unintended adverse outcomes: they insufficiently understand the link between action and outcome. They prove limited understanding of their habitat.</p>
<p>Agents who, more often than not, effectively predict the pattern of consequences of their own behaviors learn they can rely on their own predictions and become <strong>self-directed</strong>. Self-directors have brought their agency under self-control. They can, given their habitat, safely self-decide and can become effective co-creators and autonomous actors.</p>
<p>Self-directors are <strong>fully autonomous</strong> agents who truly self-maintain their existence (while being embedded in and dependent on a habitat to which they contribute). They prove they generally <strong>understand</strong> the consequences of their own actions and hence tend to <strong>appraise the habitat as safe and  opportunity rich</strong>. They are mostly co-creating and are the authority of their life. They exhibit an <strong>internal locus of control</strong> and are self-optimizing their life. In general they are happy.</p>
<p>Agents who often fail to predict the consequences of their own behaviors live in a world of random outcomes. When they self-decide, they are more often than not confronted with unforeseen, typically negative outcomes that they cannot couple to their own actions.</p>
<p>In general they <strong>appraise the habitat as unsafe and problematic</strong>. This activates undirected anxiety (related to the state of the whole habitat, not at something in it), and they are mostly coping.</p>
<p>Since they often cannot rely on their own decision-making to realize intended benefits, they fall back and rely on social mimicry, which externalizes the locus of control.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/cc-inadequacy-adequacy.png" alt="Inadequacy versus adequacy"></p>
<h2 id="inadequacy-versus-adequacy">Inadequacy versus adequacy</h2>
<p>Adequacy is the skill to prevent most problems and to quickly and effectively solve this who could not be prevented. Adequacy is always defined with respect to the habitat. Adequacy in one habitat does not entail adequacy in another.</p>
<p>Yet the more skills are generalized, they become effective in a wider range of habitats and over longer time-scales. Opportunity exploration and participatory engagement with the habitat, characteristics of co-creation, promote this.</p>
<p>We refer to <strong>adequacy with respect to the habitat</strong> as the combination of</p>
<ul>
<li>sufficient skills,</li>
<li>an understanding of the link between behavior and its pattern of likely outcomes,</li>
<li>self-direction,</li>
<li>an internal locus of control,</li>
<li>full autonomy,</li>
<li>a general appraisal of the habitat as safe and full of opportunities, and</li>
<li>a <strong>general feeling of &ldquo;happiness&rdquo;</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short <strong>adequacy</strong> is the ability to prevent most problems, and to quickly end those who could not be prevented.</p>
<p>Similarly, we refer to <strong>inadequacy with respect to the habitat</strong> as the combination of</p>
<ul>
<li>insufficient skills,</li>
<li>a lack of understanding of the link between behavior and outcomes,</li>
<li>only partial self-direction,</li>
<li>an external locus of control,</li>
<li>bounded autonomy,</li>
<li>a general appraisal of the habitat as unsafe and problematic, and</li>
<li>a broadly felt <strong>undirected anxiety</strong> (as counterpart of happiness)</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, <strong>inadequacy</strong> is the inability to prevent or quickly end problems, which entails that problem states persists, and are in part self-created and self-maintained. We refer to this as a <strong>coping trap</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/cc-attitudes-to-diversity.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="attitudes-to-diversity">Attitudes to diversity</h2>
<p>Agents are sources of behavior and the behaviors of many indepently acting agents denotes an explosion of habitat complexity. Habitat complexity is a challenge for all agents, but most to the least skilled. Habitat complexity activates complementary motivations in <strong>adequate</strong> and <strong>inadequate</strong> agents.</p>
<p>Adequate agents perceive many affordances and are <strong>motivated to explore habitat opportunities</strong> and they leave constructive traces in the habitat for the benefit of self and others. In doing so they enhance and protect viability of self and the broader habitat. For the adequate <strong>diversity is a resource</strong>.</p>
<p>In contrast, inadequacy leads to a focus on the <strong>restoration of adequacy</strong>. And given the root cause of inadequacy – a lack of understanding between behavior and habitat outcome – this motivates agents to make the habitat more predictable (again). This manifests as an <strong>urgency to reduce the unpredictability of the habitat</strong>. And since self-directed agent activities are huge source of habitat complexity the focus is on curtailing agency.</p>
<p>This manifests at <strong>intolerance to (ill-understood) diversity</strong>. And that particularly includes all strategies of co-creators that exceed the inadequate&rsquo;s scope of understanding.</p>
<p>Typically, the inadequate appraise the most active and effective co-creators as sources of <strong>intolerable diversity to be controlled or removed.</strong></p>
<p><em>The strong urge to curtail and control the behaviors of others is a characteristic of coping.</em></p>
<p>Resistance to the behavior curtailment is known as <strong>reactance</strong>. It is always reactive and usually weaker because the adequate typically have plenty of alternatives.</p>
<p>On in individual level, intolerance to diversity leads to self-curtailing of behavioral diversity by complying with some emerging norm. This norm does not need to be optimal or even sensible, it just needs to lead to a less complex habitat.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/cc-shared-inadequacy.png" alt="Shared inadequacy"></p>
<h2 id="shared-inadequacy">Shared inadequacy</h2>
<p>Typically, agents form a (never stable and ever-developing) web of relations. These relations can be <strong>tension free</strong> and conducive for co-operation. Or they can be <strong>tension laden</strong> and conducive for conflict.</p>
<p>In addition agents may differ in interaction styles that we have denoted as <strong>style 1 and 2</strong>. Given these and other complications, agents vary in adequacy.</p>
<p>Normally, most agents are in a co-creation mode and as such they secure their own viability, while securing future habitat viability via stigmergy. In doing so, life gradually creates room for more life.</p>
<p>Because co-creating agents <strong>focus on viability of self in the habitat</strong>, they need to maintain and develop individual adequacy. What they do to a lesser degree is to focus on reducing inter-agent tension.</p>
<p>In contrast, inadequate individuals share an urge to reduce habitat complexity to restore adequacy by reducing uneasiness towards the habitat as a whole. This <strong>undirected anxiety</strong> is so broadly aimed that it is not actionable. Combined with agent inadequacy and the associated risk of harming self and others, this leads to <strong>atomized individuals</strong> who withdraw to prevent being confronted by their own adequacy.</p>
<p>However when inadequate agents meet they find the associated reduced behavioral complexity of fellow inadequates attractive. And they share and <strong>intolerance to all diversity</strong> beyond the scope of understanding.</p>
<p>One possible collaborative strategy is to <strong>promote sameness</strong> by <strong>controlling or removing sources of diversity</strong>.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter what type of sameness is promoted, as long as it reduces diversity.</p>
<p>This strategy provides a <strong>focus to undirected anxiety</strong> and makes it actionable as an urge to increase sameness. In addition the collaboration creates a sense of community and purpose that relieves the social atomization.</p>
<p>This leads to a strategy of <strong>social mimicry</strong>. Since social mimicry starts local, it gives rise to multiple local clusters of agents that each agree on a local form of sameness.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cc-inter-agent-tension-reduction.png" alt="cc-sameness-ingroup-forming.png"></p>
<h2 id="social-mimicry-inter-agent-tension-reduction">Social mimicry: inter-agent tension reduction</h2>
<p>In situations of <strong>increasing habitat complexity</strong>, many agents experience <strong>increased inadequacy</strong> and atomization and <strong>transit to the coping mode</strong>. This entails a habitat wide strategy shift from self-directed optimization of individual and habitat viability, to strategies focused on reducing habitat diversity and promoting sameness.</p>
<p>In fact, the group-level expression of social mimicry entails a shift to <strong>inter-agent tension reduction</strong>. Inter-agent tension is a measure of the unpredictability (perceived randomness) of the behavior of other agents. The more predictable their behavior, the lower the inter-agent tension.</p>
<p>Generally, <strong>inadequate agents experience a much higher tension from adequate individuals than vice versa</strong> because co-creating agents have higher self-direction and behavioral complexity.</p>
<p>When all group members select from a narrow range of well-known behaviors, within-group tensions are minimized: <strong>everyone acts predictably in the eyes of others and behavioral complexity is low.</strong> This reduces the probability of being confronted with one&rsquo;s inadequacy. But it does not normally improve the habitat.</p>
<p>At some point, groups of inadequate copers &ldquo;surround&rdquo; adequate self-directors. As a group they are confronted with a source of ill-understood diversity.</p>
<p>This directs both their intolerance to diversity (a strategy) and free-floating anxiety (which determines urgency).</p>
<p><img src="/images/cc-sameness-ingroup-forming.png" alt="cc-sameness-ingroup-forming.png"></p>
<h2 id="social-mimicry-sameness-and-in-group-forming">Social mimicry: sameness and in-group forming</h2>
<p>The resulting tension resolves when either the co-creator is <strong>coerced</strong> to limit its overt behavior down to the complexity of group-level shared behaviors or the co-creator is <strong>purged</strong>. In short the options are <strong>adapt, leave, or die</strong>.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;leave or die&rdquo; option manifest a <strong>&lsquo;disgust reaction&rsquo;</strong> in the sense of distancing from a toxic, influence that represents no positive value and deserves no protection.</p>
<p>Sameness promotion leads to the formation of an <strong>in-group</strong>: a group of agents who share similar adequacy limits, who share an in-group specific set of behaviors and motivations, and who behave in ways to minimize the frequency of ill-understood diversity.</p>
<p>Within an in-group, the agents who determine the content of sameness most<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, have a special position. They are even less confronted with inadequacy because the content of sameness fits their inadequacy evasion strategies better than others.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The ability to determine the content of sameness makes them <strong>authoritative</strong> within the in-group.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Due to the limits that in-group members impose on each other&rsquo;s behavior, co-creation becomes very difficult, if not impossible. But high-functioning in-group members<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> will be less often confronted with their inadequacy, and thus experience markedly reduced anxiety.</p>
<p>Co-creators do not form in-groups. Instead they form flexible communities of freely cooperating individuals that each <strong>promote individual short and long-term viability in the habitat context</strong>. For that they need to constantly update life-skills and adequacy through participatory engagement with the habitat.</p>
<p>Ironically, the behaviors that help to increase life-skills and lead to <strong>individual and habitat growth</strong> are also the source of complexity that the inadequate are intolerant to and try to suppress. This entails that in-groups actively counteract the very influences that can improve their quality of life. It locks them in a <strong>coping trap</strong> with minimal viability.</p>
<p>This also points to a characteristic difference between copers and co-creators: faced with challenges co-creators skill-up while copers reduce habitat complexity and skill-down in the service of sameness.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/cc-oneness-centralization-of-authority.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="oneness-centralization-of-authority">Oneness: centralization of authority</h2>
<p>The local promotion of sameness leads to the formation of multiple unequal groups that at some point meet. And that leads to tension between two or more unequal in-groups.</p>
<p>Because in-groups understand base their cognition on little more than their own sameness, they are <strong>unable to predict the outcomes of the actions of out-groups</strong>. The resulting sense of inadequacy directs the copers broadly felt anxiety and activates an urge to reduce the diversity between the two in-groups.</p>
<p>Again the tension, and likely overt conflict, persists as long as the differences persist. The tension manifests as a balance between incompatible tendencies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>protected in-group sameness</li>
<li>oppose and counteract the out-group&rsquo;s sameness, and</li>
<li>extend the scope of the own sameness.</li>
</ul>
<p>At some point in time, possibly after conflict and at great costs of in- and out-groups, an enlarged <strong>in-group</strong> emerges<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Once this is established the anxiety associated with inadequacy becomes undirected again. (Which entails it is ready to be redirected to a new source of ill-understood diversity.)</p>
<p>The enlarged in-group has some <em>sameness style</em> that is now adopted by more agents, who in part needed to change their style. The in-group is only stable when it sufficiently suppresses emerging or latent diversity within the in-group. This entails that in-groups above a critical size need to invest in in-group diversity curtailment<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Stable authority needs an infrastructure to implement intolerance to diversity (which may also suppresses the benefits of co-creation).</p>
<p>And as long as out-groups exists, perhaps as slightly different subpopulations of the in-group, its authoritative structures need to be ready and able suppress diversity and enlarge oneness.</p>
<p>In-groups, as authoritative structures, have a natural tendency to grow. And since this holds even when resources can better be used in other ways<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>, this can be a drain on resources.</p>
<p>This enriches the role of <strong>authority</strong>: it is not only a sources of a particular sameness, but it also represents the center of an infrastructure that contributes to the stability of the particular sameness that its inadequate members need to prevent being confronted with their inadequacy.</p>
<p>The previous provides insight in the basics of authority. Authority is:</p>
<ol>
<li>A source of sameness that allows the inadequate to evade feelings of inadequacy</li>
<li>An Infra-structure to suppress diversity and extend the scope of sameness</li>
<li>A way to address the needs of those that cannot provide for themselves and who exchange their agency in return.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the same time communities of co-creators within a habitat comprising of mores skilled, more diverse, and hence unique individuals hardly feel conflict when confronted with another groups of skilled, diverse and unique individuals. They use the added diversity as a resource to <strong>enhance the life-skills</strong> necessary for a habitat wide local optimization process of each agent in its environment.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cc-phase-transition-mass-formation.png" alt="Oneness and Authority centralization"></p>
<h2 id="phase-transition-mass-formation">Phase transition: mass formation</h2>
<p>The previous, assumed that the mass transition from co-creation to coping just happened. The transition process is actually a complex phenomenon that resembles what physics refers to as a phase transition (like from liquid to solid).</p>
<p>Different individuals transit at different moments and probably multiple times to and fro before settling in the other mode. This depending on how the complexity of the habitat is appraised. The higher the appraised complexity, the more likely coping becomes.</p>
<p>Since coping comes with social mimicry, it leads to a positive feedback loop where more and more inadequate agents adopt a <strong>perceived majority style</strong>. For individuals this might entail some flip-flopping, before discovering the style of the emergent majority.</p>
<p>This <strong>mass formation</strong> process adopts, ever quicker, most inadequate agents into a growing in-groups that coalesce, seemingly in an instant, to an in-group that spans all corners of the habitat. That is the phase transition due to the habitat wide <strong>promotion of sameness and oneness</strong>.</p>
<p>The member of the habitat-spanning but still sparse in-group experience tension wherever adequate self-deciders still co-create and hence stand out on the just-created background of sameness. This <strong>directs the in-group&rsquo;s undirected anxiety</strong> to the remaining self-deciders.</p>
<p>The remaining self-deciders stall regression towards further uniformity, simplification, and complete habitat dysfunctio<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. So resistance to emerging sameness, while individually dangerous, is essential to preserve part of the previous well-functioning of the habitat<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cc-mass-cognition.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="mass-cognition">Mass cognition</h2>
<p><strong>Mass cognition</strong> is the emerging behavior selection structure among the <strong>inadequate</strong>. It is a group-level manifestation of <strong>coping</strong> that starts with not having the <strong>skills</strong> to</p>
<ol>
<li>prevent unintended outcomes of behaviors and</li>
<li>being unable to predict the pattern of behaviors of others.</li>
</ol>
<p>The inadequate live in a world with random outcomes where they do <strong>not understand</strong> the <strong>relation between action and outcomes</strong>.</p>
<p>Being unable to prevent <strong>unintended harmful outcomes</strong> of behaviors activates an urge restore adequacy through reducing habitat unpredictability. This leads to the <strong>promotion of oneness and sameness</strong> through <strong>control and removal of sources of diversity</strong>. Out-groups are given the options <strong>adapt, leave, or die</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the inability to predict the behaviors of others activates an urge to <strong>curtail and control their behaviors</strong>. Again this leads to the options <strong>adapt, leave, or die</strong>.</p>
<p>The overall strategy of mass cognition can be summarized as: <strong>the exclusion of all diversity activating agentic inadequacy</strong>.</p>
<p>This control strategy effectively aims to reduce an unconstrained open world to a controlled closed world that excludes all that freaks out the inadequate<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. And that is why it gains broad support.</p>
<p>Even during a mass formation event there is still a minority of adequate agents who persist in co-creation strategies, albeit very much curtailed.</p>
<p>For the habitat as a whole this entails that the features of co-creation are minimally expressed. Only <strong>few improve and protect the viability of the habitat</strong>, <strong>few are able and motivated to explore opportunities</strong>, and <strong>few see diversity as a resource</strong>.</p>
<p>During mass formation the <strong>habitat is appraised</strong> as unsafe, deficient, and full of problems, and only few experience it as <strong>safe enough to explore opportunities</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="link-with-authoritarianism">Link with authoritarianism</h2>
<p>What we have been describing for a general living agent manifests within humanity as &ldquo;authoritarianism&rdquo;. And particularly as conceptualized by Karen Stenner in her 2005 book &ldquo;The Authoritarian dynamic&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In fact our narrative provides a first principles derivation of the defining features of authoritarianism</p>
<p>Stenner writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, what authoritarianism  actually does is [it] inclines one toward attitudes and behaviors variously concerned with <strong>structuring society</strong> and <strong>social interactions</strong> in ways that <strong>enhance sameness</strong> and <strong>minimize diversity of people, beliefs, and behaviors</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to <strong>&ldquo;promoting sameness &amp; oneness&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;inter-agent tension reduction&rdquo;</strong>. Stenner continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It tends to produce a characteristic array of stances, all of which have the effect of <strong>glorifying, encouraging, and rewarding uniformity</strong> and of <strong>disparaging, suppressing, and punishing difference</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggest <strong>&ldquo;social mimicry&rdquo;</strong> as the driver of uniformity. And it indicates that <strong>&ldquo;diversity is a threat&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since <strong>enhancing uniformity and minimizing diversity</strong> implicate others  and  require  some  <strong>control  over  their  behavior</strong>,  ultimately  these stances involve <strong>actual coercion of others</strong> (as in driving a black family from the neighborhood) and, more frequently, <strong>demands for the use of group authority</strong> (i.e., coercion by the state).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bluntly states that <strong>sources of diversity must me controlled or removed</strong> via <strong>curtailing and controlling the behaviors of out-groups</strong>.</p>
<p>Stenner also states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“authoritarianism alone is heavily determined by cognitive incapacity to deal with complexity and difference”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is a way to define inadequacy.</p>
<p>This all leads to what we refer to as the Authoritarian Motto: <strong>&ldquo;We impose our sameness on others&rdquo;</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="/images/cc-authoritarian-dynamic.png" alt="link text"></p>
<h2 id="the-authoritarian-dynamic">The authoritarian dynamic</h2>
<p>Stenner produced a simple formula to predict the strength of the <strong>intolerance to difference</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Intolerance to difference = authoritarianism x normative threat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <strong>normative threat</strong> is threat to the <strong>normative order.</strong> And she defines that as <strong>a system of oneness and sameness that makes &ldquo;us&rdquo; an &ldquo;us&rdquo;</strong>. An out-group implementing some other sameness is annoying, but not really a threat. A normative threat is something that markedly erodes the in-group&rsquo;s sameness and inspires in-group members to first mimic it and secondly to self-directedly improve on it.</p>
<p>Stenner specifically mentions <strong>authorities proving unworthy of trust and loss of societal consensus</strong>.</p>
<p>In her research Stenner used 5 simple two-option questions about how children should act to determine whether individuals act as authoritarian or as self-decider.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Children should:</th>
<th>Children should:</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Obey parents</td>
<td>Be responsible for their actions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Have good manners</td>
<td>Have good sense and sound judgement</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Be neat and clean</td>
<td>Be interested in how and why things happen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Have respect for elders</td>
<td>Think for themselves</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Follow the rules</td>
<td>Follow their own conscience</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The options on the left correspond to an <strong>external locus of control</strong> and exhibit <strong>social mimicry</strong>. The options on the right correspond to an <strong>internal locus of control</strong> and <strong>self-decision</strong>. Both key features of <strong>inadequacy</strong>. Individuals how scored high on the first options are classified as authoritarian. This also reflects characteristics of <strong>adequacy</strong>.</p>
<p>To an authoritarian a normative threat is anything that self-empowers other agents to mimic less and self-decide more since this leads to a crumbling of the sameness and oneness designed to evade confrontation with one&rsquo;s inadequacy.</p>
<p>In the absence of normative threats, authoritarians are not intolerant to diversity; a perceived normative threat changes this immediately.</p>
<p>In generalizes summary of much of the previous is that <strong>coping dominance</strong> is activated by by a combination of <strong>inadequacy</strong> and the threat of <strong>increased habitat complexity</strong> due to highly visible self-deciding co-creators – adequate individuals –  who inspire and empower others with more effective and more realistic ideas, insights, and activities that benefit the habitat on the short and long term in ways that elude the inadequate.</p>

<h2 id="the-disgust-reaction">The disgust reaction</h2>
<p>The group-level disgust reaction is in characteristic response to a <strong>normative threat</strong> that is experienced as a <strong>threat to self</strong>.</p>
<p>Specifically a group-level disgust reaction a <strong>strong self-protective immediate reaction to purge the group from an effect felt to be toxic</strong>.</p>
<p>This is a rich description that points towards the main features of the associated decision-making.</p>
<ul>
<li>That it is a strong reaction indicates <strong>urgency</strong>.</li>
<li>It is self-protective and hence <strong>disregards the target</strong>.</li>
<li>Immediacy <strong>precludes meta-cognition</strong>.</li>
<li>Purging entails that the <strong>target is isolated from the group</strong>.</li>
<li>The group-level response entails a <strong>reliance on (shared) in-group level sameness</strong>.</li>
<li>The threat is strictly not the target, but some <strong>unspecified negative influence</strong> on self.</li>
<li>That negative influence is reacted to with a <strong>sub-rational drive</strong> (although it can always be rationally justified).</li>
<li>Finally, toxicity entails <strong>harmful, malign, and potentially deadly</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This breakdown of the definition of group-level disgust points to the  key features the in-group behavior selection:</p>
<ol>
<li>That the target is treated as harmful, malign, and dangerous influence to be disregard and distanced from entails that <strong>interaction with the target is minimized</strong>. The target is not part of the decision-making</li>
<li>The response is a group response of inadequate individuals who share their in-group sameness that characterises their in-group defines and is an able to protect via its <strong>shared knowledge such as rules, procedures, norms, ideologies, &hellip;</strong></li>
<li>The urgency, lack of meta-cognition, reliance on explicit knowledge, and deep sub-rational drive ensures only <strong>superficial cognition</strong> (and definitely no co-creative contributions)</li>
<li>The urgency, lack of corrective meta-cognition, in the deep sub-rational drive entails that the outcomes are basically fixed from the start.</li>
</ol>
<p>The target is isolated, de-individualized, and perceived as a valueless threat The target is confronted with two options.</p>
<p>The first option is <strong>&ldquo;We impose our sameness on you&rdquo;</strong>. And the second **&ldquo;We strip you of your agency&rdquo;. Options corresponds to adapt, option 2 to or leave or die.</p>
<p>The first option is that the target <strong>recants</strong> and passes through a <strong>humiliating procedure</strong> in which it has to <strong>denounce its diversity, its individuality, and proof its in-group worthiness<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</strong> This option purges the diversity and restores oneness.</p>
<p>When the target is sufficiently self-directed and refuses to be brought down to the demanded sameness, restoration of oneness is impossible. The focus then moves to the expulsion of the</p>

<p>Core Cognition is the cognition shared by all of life. Core Cognition describes the basic decision making structures that allowed living agents to grow a biosphere from small and fragile to extensive, robust, incredibly diverse, and highly efficient. Core cognition describes the processes of behavior selection for <strong>survival</strong> and <strong>thriving</strong>, which is something that is relevant for all of living individuals: from bacteria to humans. But cognition for flourishing – coping – is essentially different from the cognition for survival – co-creation. This website addressed the power and consequences of this basic idea and we argue that also human cognition (psychology) manifests core cognition in all its key properties.</p>
<p>Florence and Tjeerd introduce these papers in a youtube video:</p>

<p><em>Table: Key differences between coping and co-creation</em></p>
<p>One way of summarizing these differences is that coping assumes a closed world: all agentic efforts are focused on the perceived problem or threat and a solution space (umwelt) is created that is just big enough to allow the individual to deal with the problem in the least risky and most effective (but not necessarily best) way known to the agent.</p>
<p>In contrast, co-creation assumes an open world: a world in which everything has a potential influence on everything else and where infinitely many ways exist to prevent future problems and equally many ways exist to build on the traces previous behaviors left in the environment. The associated Umwelt is effectively unlimited here. This is the mode that can optimize everything in the context of everything else, where the sheer infinite set of possible contributions entail the freedom to act in ways that come easy.</p>
<p>Coping feels forced because it is activated  by problems and threats and behaviors must be selected reactively from a small set to avoid harm or death. There is always a degree of urgency and an experience of being compelled to respond rather than being fully free to self-decide. Co-creation feels unforced since is allowed by the absence of threats and pressing needs, which allows behaviors to be experienced as unforced, truly self-selected, and Bradly beneficial.</p>
<p>Core cognition intends to become the theoretical framework that explains many features of our daily experience and interactions with the world. In particular it allows the develop or improve an outsiders perspective on your own daily functioning in a complex social and natural world.</p>

<h2 id="being-by-doing">Being by doing</h2>
<p>A living entity is different from a dead entity because it self-maintains this difference. <strong>To live</strong> entails self-maintaining and self-constructing a “far from equilibrium state”. The work of Prigogine (1973) showed that, for thermodynamic reasons, such an inherently unstable system can only be maintained via a continual throughput of matter and energy (e.g., food and oxygen). <strong>Death</strong> coincides with the moment self-maintenance stops. From this moment on, the formerly living entity moves towards equilibrium and becomes an integral and eventually indistinguishable part of the environment.</p>
<p>A living entity “is” — exists — because it “does”: it <strong>satisfies its needs</strong> by maintaining the throughput of matter and energy by “<em>adaptively regulating its coupling with its environment so that it sustains itself</em>” (Andringa et al., 2015; Barandiaran, Di Paolo, &amp; Rohde, 2009 p. 8). An autonomous organization that does this is called a “living agent” or an <strong>agent</strong> for short (Barandiaran et al., 2009). Note that we refer to an agent when the text pertains to life in general and is part of core cognition. Where we specifically refer to humans we use the term “person”. The term “individual” can refer to both, depending on context.</p>
<p>Life is precarious (Di Paolo, 2009), in the sense that it must be maintained actively in a world that is often not conducive to self-maintenance and where both action and inaction can have high viability consequences (including death). We refer to <strong>behavior</strong> as agent-initiated context-appropriate activities with expected future utility that counteract this precariousness and minimize the probability of death. Behavior is always aimed at remaining as viable as possible, since harm — viability reduction — can more easily end a low-viability than a high-viability existence.</p>
<p>A pattern of behaviors that effectively optimizes viability leads to <strong>flourishing</strong>, while a pattern of ineffective or misguided behaviors leads first to <strong>languishing</strong> and eventually to death. Life is “being by doing” the right things (Froese &amp; Ziemke 2009, p. 473). <strong>Viability</strong> is a holistic measure of the success or failure of “doing the right things”, since it is defined as the probabilistic distance from death: the higher the agent’s <strong>viability</strong>, the lower the probability of the discontinuation of life. A walrus that falls off a cliff may be perfectly healthy, but it has zero viability, since it will die the moment it hits the ground. While healthy, it is in mortal and inescapable danger, and hence unviable. In general, <strong>threat</strong> signifies a perceived reduction of contextappropriate behavioral options that allow the agent to survive. Maximizing viability (flourishing) and minimizing danger (survival) constitute basic motivations of life. In fact, we call any system <strong>cognitive</strong> when its behavior is governed by the norms of the system’s own continued existence and flourishing (Di Paolo &amp; Thompson, 2014). This is also a reformulation of “being by doing”.</p>
<h2 id="cognition-for-survival-and-thriving">Cognition for Survival and Thriving</h2>
<p><strong>Agency</strong> entails <strong>cognition</strong>: behavior selection for survival (avoiding death) and thriving (Barandiaran et al., 2009) (optimizing viability of self and habitat). We have argued that cognition for survival is quite different from cognition for thriving (Andringa et al., 2015). Cognition for survival is aimed at solving problems, where a <strong>problem</strong> is any perceived threat to agent viability, interpreted as a pressing need that activates <strong>reactive behavior</strong>. We called this form of cognition <strong>coping</strong>. In humans, (fluid) intelligence is a measure of problem-solving and task-completion capacity and manifests coping. The objective of coping is ending/solving the problems that activated the coping mode, so ideally coping is a temporary state. We refer to the problem-solving <em>ability,</em> including successful test and task completion ability (Gottfredson, 1997; van der Maas, Kan, &amp; Borsboom, 2014), as <strong>intelligence</strong>.</p>
<p>However, when the agent’s problem solving is inadequate and problems are not solved and are potentially worsened or increased, the perceived viability threat remains activated and the agent is trapped in the coping mode of behavior. A <strong>coping trap</strong> keeps the agent in continued threatened viability, and hence in behaviors aimed at short-term self-protection in suboptimal states that are far from flourishing. Maslow (1968) calls this deficiency (D) cognition, since it is ultimately activated by unfulfilled needs. It is a sign that the intelligence of the agent failed to end (solve) problem states.</p>
<p>While the coping mode of behavior is for survival, the co-creation mode is for flourishing. Successful coping leads to solved problems and satisfied needs, and hence to its deactivation. Therefore, co-creation is the default mode of cognition and coping is — ideally — only a temporary fallback to deal with a problematic situation. Continued activation is the success measure of the co-creation mode and avoiding problems (or dealing with them before they become pressing) is, therefore, the main objective of co-creation. It is essentially proactive behavior (thus not just “proactive coping”, since successful coping leads to its deactivation). Maslow (1968) refers to co-creation as being (B) cognition, and we described it as pervasive optimization and “generalized wisdom”, for reasons which will become apparent. The objective of co-creation is pro-actively producing indirect viability benefits through self-guided habitat contributions that improve the conditions for future agentic existence.</p>
<p>This is known as <strong>stigmergy</strong>: building on the constructive traces of past behaviors left in the environment (Doyle &amp; Marsh, 2013; Gloag et al., 2013; Heylighen, 2016b; 2016a) and that, in the aggregate, gradually increase habitat viability. This expresses <strong>authority</strong> as a shaping force in the habitat (Marsh &amp; Onof, 2008), via influencing others through habitat contributions. <strong>Habitat</strong> is defined as the environment from which agents can derive all they need to survive (and thrive) and to which they contribute to ensure long-term viability of the self and others.</p>
<p><strong>Habitat viability</strong> is a measure of the potential of the habitat to satisfy the conditions for agentic existence (i.e., satisfied agentic needs). For example, a habitat can be deficient in the sense that its inhabitants continually have unfulfilled needs (and hence are in the coping mode). The habitat can also be rich, so that pressing needs can easily be satisfied and co-creative contributions can perpetuate and enhance habitat viability.</p>
<p>The <strong>biosphere</strong> grew from fragile and localized to robust and extensive, so we know beyond doubt that life on Earth is, in the aggregate, a constructive force. It is the co-creation mode’s contributions to habitat viability that explain this. In fact, the biosphere can be seen as the outcome of stigmergy: the sum total of all agentic traces left in the environment since the origin of life (Andringa et al., 2015). Co-creation and generalized wisdom as the main cognitive ability drive the biosphere’s growth and gradually increase its <strong>carrying capacity:</strong> the sum total of all life activity in the biosphere. This makes co-creation the most authoritative influence on Earth. Coping is also an important authoritative influence, but it is limited to setting up and maintaining the conditions for pressing need satisfaction.</p>

<h4 id="figure-1-lifes-demand">Figure 1. Life’s demand</h4>
<center> Maintaining and increasing viability of self and habitat (based on Andringa & Angyal, 2019). Pervasive optimization of agent and habitat viability leads to increased carrying capacity and more life.</center>
<p>Figure 1 presents the co-dependence of acting agents on their habitat. The habitat comprises the aggregate of agentic activities, but is not an actor itself. Hence, a viable habitat is composed of the sumtotal of previous co-creative agentic traces that form a resource to satisfy the conditions on which current agentic existence depends. This entails that, signified by the question marks, agents should be aware not only of their own viability, but also of habitat viability. In fact, we have argued (Andringa, van den Bosch, &amp; Weijermans, 2015) that early, primitive life forms were yet unable to separate self from the co-dependence of self and habitat. This leads to an “<strong>original perspective</strong>” on the combined viability of agent and habitat, which allowed their primitive cognition to optimize the whole, while addressing selfish needs and creating ever better conditions for agentic life. This can be termed <strong>pervasive optimization</strong> and it expresses an emergent purpose of life on Earth to produce more life. Albert Schweitzer (1998) formulated a slightly weaker version of this “I am life that wills to live in the midst of life that wills to live.”</p>
<h2 id="well-being-and-adequacy">Well-being and adequacy</h2>
<p>Pervasive optimization is the driver of <strong>well-being</strong>. We propose that successful well-being, with a focus on ‘being’ and hence interpreted as a verb, can best be understood as a co-creation process leading to high viability agents, increased habitat viability, and long-term protection and extension of the conditions on which existence depends.</p>
<p>The two modes of behavior have quite different impacts on the habitat and, by extension, the biosphere. The coping mode is aimed at protecting and improving agent viability with whatever means the agent has access to. Since the objective is avoiding death, the motivation is high, which entails that habitat resources can be sacrificed for self-preservation purposes. <strong>Inadequacy</strong> can be defined as the tendency to self-create, prolong, or worsen problems that keep an agent in the coping mode. When a habitat is dominated by inadequate agents, as is characteristic of a social level coping trap, habitat viability cannot be maintained, let alone increased. From the perspective of coping, life is at best a zero-sum game.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>adequacy</strong> can be defined as the ability to avoid problems or end them quickly so that coping is effective and rare. Now co-creation is prevalent so that habitat viability is protected, carrying capacity increases, and long-term need satisfaction is secured. Co-creation is, like the term suggests, a <em>more than zero sum game</em>. This is, as argued above, the true basis of well-being. Due to its lack of “co-creation”, coping <em>protects</em> lower levels of well-being and, at best, resolves (or otherwise takes care of) viability threats (in the sense of removing symptoms of low well-being), while co-creation allows both agent and habitat flourishing.</p>
<p>The inadequacy-adequacy dimension might underlie the proposed single dimension of psychopathology termed p (Lahey et al., 2012; Caspi and Moffit, 2018). This has been conceptualized as “a continuum between adaptive and maladaptive functioning”, “successful versus unsuccessful functioning”, a disposition for negative emotionality or impulsive responsivity to emotion, and unrealistic thoughts that manifest in extreme cases as delusions and hallucinations (Smith et al., 2020). All descriptions fit with our interpretation of inadequacy as the tendency to self-create, prolong, or worsen problems and adequacy as the ability to avoid problems or end them quickly.</p>
<p>Welzel and Inglehart (2010) argue, from the perspective of cultural evolution, “that feelings of agency are linked to human well-being through a sequence of adaptive mechanisms that promote human development, once existential conditions become permissive”, which is a formulation of the dynamics of Figure 1. They argue that “greater agency involves higher adaptability because for individuals as well as societies, agency means the power to act purposely to their advantage”. This uses the concept of agency as a <em>measure</em> of the ability to self-maintain viability, which is related to adequacy.</p>
<h2 id="behavioral-repertoire-and-worldview">Behavioral repertoire and worldview</h2>
<p>Living agents, per definition, need to express behavior to perpetuate their existence. And with every intentional action, the agent implicitly relies on the set of all that it takes as reliable (i.e., true in the sense of reflecting reality as it is) enough to base behavior on. We refer to this set as the agent’s <strong>worldview</strong>. A worldview should be a stable basis, as well as developing over time because it is informed by the individual’s learning history. An agent’s worldview informs its appraisal of the immediate environment. This may be an appraisal of its viability state: whether the habitat is safe or not, or whether it judges the current situation as manageable, too complex, or opportunity filled.</p>
<p>These are basic appraisals shared by all of life that seem to be reflected in the psychological concept of core affect (Russell, 2003). Core affect is a mood-level construct that combines the axis unpleasureable-pleasurable with an arousal axis spanning deactivated to maximally activated. It is intimately and bidirectionally linked to appraisal (Kuppens, Champagne, &amp; Tuerlinckx, 2012; van den Bosch, Welch, &amp; Andringa, 2018) and refers directly to whether one is free to act or forced to respond: whether one can co-create proactively or has to cope reactively. Hence appraisal is a worldview-based motivational response to the perceived viability consequences of the present state of the world. It is motivational, but not yet action. As such appraisal resembles Frijda’s (1986) emotion definition as ‘action readiness’. Which fits with the notion that all cognition is essentially anticipatory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Cognitive systems anticipate future events when selecting actions, they subsequently learn from what actually happens when they do act, and thereby they modify subsequent expectations and, in the process, they change how the world is perceived and what actions are possible. Cognitive systems do all of this autonomously.” (Vernon 2010, pp. 89).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The anticipation of the development of the world (comprising of self and environment) refers back to what we earlier introduced as the “original perspective” on the combined viability of agent and habitat, which allowed the first life forms to optimize the whole, while addressing selfish needs and creating ever better conditions for more agentic life. Core affect is a term adopted from psychology (Russell, 2003) that we here generalize to all of life. Core affect is a relation to the world as a whole and not a relation to something specific in that world. Like moods, core affect does not have (or need) the intentionality (directedness) of emotions and it is, unlike emotions, continually present to self-report (van den Bosch, Welch, &amp; Andringa, 2018).</p>
<p>The human worldview is, of course, filled with explicit and shared beliefs, opinions, facts, or ideas interpreted with and filtered by experiential knowledge. This worldview informs whether the situation is deemed dangerous or not (whether avoidance or approach is appropriate). This holds also for a general agent: when the agent judges the situation as safe it can express unconstrained natural behaviors since it has to satisfy few constraints. If the situation is safe and opportunity-filled, it can be interested and learn. But if the situation imposes many constraints, it tries to end these by establishing control. And in a deficient environment the agent is devoid of opportunities (which in humans may correspond to boredom or, in case of lost opportunities, sadness). Core affect then is expressed as motivations to avoid or end (coping) or motivations to perpetuate or to aim for (co-creation). We have depicted this in Figure 2.</p>
<p>Appraisal of reality refers to the behavioral consequences of the current state of the world and it is a form of basic meaning-giving that activates a subset of context appropriate behavioral options (van den Bosch, Welch, &amp; Andringa, 2018). This leads to <strong>motivation</strong> as being ready to respond to the context appropriately. We define the set of all possible – appraisal and worldview dependent – behaviors as the <strong>behavioral repertoire</strong>. The richer the behavioral repertoire, the more diverse context appropriate behaviors the agent can exhibit. The more effective its behavioral repertoire, the more effective it becomes in realizing intended outcomes and the more adequate the agent is. Conversely, the less effective the context-activated behaviors, the more inadequate the agent is. <strong>Learning</strong> either reduces the ineffectiveness of behaviors or it expands the behavioral repertoire.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding the repertoire</strong> results from an individual discovery path through a representative sample of different environments and interactive learning opportunities. Broadening is effortful and potentially risky but ultimately rewarding. Fredrickson’s (2005) broaden and build theory fits here by proposing that positive emotions – indicating the absence of problems and hence co-creation – help to <em>extend</em> the scope of behavioral options. This type of learning leads to individual skills that are, through the individual discovery path, difficult to share. This manifests in humans as implicit or tacit knowledge (Patterson et al., 2010) and well-developed agency.</p>
<p><strong>Reducing the ineffectiveness of behaviors</strong> is essential in problematic (coping) situations. This may entail adopting, through <strong>social</strong> <strong>mimicry</strong>, the behaviors of (seemingly) more successful, healthy, or otherwise attractive agents. The adoption of presumed effective behaviors manifests shared knowledge. Mimicry is a quick fix and works wherever and as long as the adopted behaviors are effective. As a dominant learning strategy, mimicry leads to a coordinated situation of sameness and oneness. The coordinated agents make their adequacy conditional to the narrow set of situations where the mimicked behaviors work. These agents may be intolerant to others who frustrate sameness and oneness. They may express this intolerance by selecting behaviors that enforce social mimicry on non-mimickers. The more they feel threatened, the more they feel an urge to restore the conditions for adequacy and the more intolerant to diversity they are. In humans this is expressed as the authoritarian dynamic (Stenner, 2005).</p>

                <h2 id="section-2---coping-and-co-creation">Section 2 - Coping and co-creation</h2>
<p>This section addresses the quite different and complementary features of coping and co-creation. We need both, because successful coping maximizes time for co-creation. The complementarity of the two modes, as two separate ontologies that disagree on many aspects, might be the root of life’s <strong>resilience.</strong> Where resilience is defined as “the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks” (Walker et al., 2004). We originate resilience in the agent’s ability to anticipate and predict.</p>
<h3 id="anticipation-and-predictability">Anticipation and Predictability</h3>
<p>Coping and co-creation are abilities – in psychology, skills and tacit knowledge (Patterson et al., 2010) – expressed as behavior in response and appropriate to how the agent appraises its habitat context. Of course, agent-initiated actions change the habitat state to which other agents may respond, which, in turn, changes the habitat state. Since the habitat may change even without direct agentic influences, agents exist in an evolving world in which they must position themselves to protect and enhance self and habitat viability. To exist in such an environment, the agent needs anticipatory models (Vernon, 2010) of the state of self and the habitat. It must update these actively, and choose its behavior to realize benefits to self and the habitat. In this open environment, even the best agent generated model leads only to partial predictability. Coping and co-creation strategies increase partial predictability, but use different strategies and complementary logics.</p>
<h2 id="coping">Coping</h2>
<p>Coping makes the world more predictable by reducing its complexity and creating systems (of agents or objects) with more predictable behavior that bring threats-to-self under control – which requires energy, resources, and continual maintenance – and promote <strong>security</strong>. The coping mode’s goal is to end perceived viability threats, and coping success entails the discontinued need for its activation. Hence, it is goal-oriented (like problem-solving and task execution) and endowed with a sense of urgency to avoid (further) viability deterioration that justifies the exploitation of previously created viability. Any deviation from manageable order – unfamiliar events or deviant agent behavior – is seen as an unwanted intrusion to be counteracted. Hence, coping leads to an effortfully controlled environment that minimizes unpredictability and diversity. If the threat level – i.e., the expected negative viability impact – increases, so does the drive to suppress diversity.</p>
<p>Since coping is goal-oriented and intends to reduce complexity, it favors shared rules (in general shared knowledge) and behavioral mimicry. The more agents follow the same rules with great precision, the more predictable agents and the habitat become. Coping promotes the spread and precise execution of a single set of behavioral rules. And it endorses an urge to correct or suppress any unwanted diversity. This is a form of social mimicry (Chartrand and van Baaren, 2009) that might not only lead to the spread of effective behavior, but also to lead to a <em>“degree of entanglement”</em> (Combs &amp; Kribner 2008, pp. 264), emergent collective behavior (via mimicry or rules), and a group level perspective.</p>
<p>In human societies, bureaucracy, the military, large corporations, and strict manifestations of religions and ideologies are examples of the coping logic. Technology, from very primitive to complex like computers, depict the best of coping by producing precise outputs as long as the physical environment (the tool and its necessary resources) and the user operate within very tight constraints; this entails trained behaviors.</p>
<p>Coordinated agentic behavior, as social mimicry, is endorsed by agents who expect benefits from more sameness and oneness. Agents with similar needs share similar coordination benefits, but that is unlikely for agents with different needs or those with other (even potentially better) strategies. In fact, imposed external coordination might be detrimental. Differences in expected benefits lead to a separation in in-groups and out-groups. An <strong>in-group</strong> is a group of agents who express a degree of oneness and sameness through social mimicry and hence share adequacy limits, perceptions of what is beneficial, how to realize these benefits, and what endangers realizing these benefits. <strong>Out-groups</strong> do not share these limits, either because they have other limits or because they are less limited. By violating sameness and oneness, out-groups frustrate coordinated coping in the eyes of in-groups. Note that out-groups might not even know they are assigned to the out-group and might not raise their defenses.</p>
<p>In-groups (as manifestation of coping) see the risk of frustrated coordinated behavior as an existential threat which justifies exploiting or suppressing out-groups and the habitat alike. Habitat and out-group exploitation may activate out-group resistance that makes goal achievement more difficult. So, the better the in-group is able to control out-groups and habitat, the more likely they are to realize intended results. Due to its problem-solving nature, coping manifests “the ability to <em>realize intended outcomes”</em>. Which is Bertrand Russell’s (1938) definition of <strong>power.</strong> Hence coping behaviors are a manifestation of power generalized to generic agents.</p>
<p>The coping mode’s manifestation of authority is typically power based in the sense that it sets-up habitat conditions for reduced diversity, increased predictability of agent behavior to facilitate intended outcomes, and to bring viability threats-to-self under control (<strong>security</strong>) . This is known as coercive authority (as opposed to legitimate authority, Hofman et al., 2017). Coercive power, generally (but not necessarily) leads to benefits for the in-group at the detriment to out-groups and the wider habitat: the zero-sum game that in humanity is associated with manifestations of authoritarianism (Stenner, 2005) and the tragedy of the commons (Hardin, 1968).</p>
<h2 id="co-creation">Co-creation</h2>
<p>Co-creation does not reduce complexity, instead it makes the world more predictable by promoting unconstrained natural behavior and easy need satisfaction through promoting and communicating efforts that facilitate and maintain habitat viability. This creates a safe environment where <strong>safety</strong> is defined as “a situation or state with <em>positive indicators</em> of the absence of viability threats” (van den Bosch et al., 2018). This communicated absence of threats is a logical necessity since an absence can otherwise not be established. The positive indicators of safety – signs of unforced agentic behavior – allow agents in the habitat to co-create without having to be alert for (unexpected) danger. This allows the uninterrupted functioning of a self-organizing network of interacting agents that satisfy needs most naturally, while minimizing negative impacts and promoting coexistence and even collaboration. Human friendships depend on this logic and they have, like all co-creation processes, no stable outcome or goal other than providing a safe context for growth and flourishing.</p>
<p>This is the complement of coordinating other agent’s behavior (which characterizes coping). Unconstrained natural behavior does not need guidance, since the agents do whatever comes naturally and return to this when constraints are lifted. This harmony between what is possible and what comes naturally stabilizes the habitat, leads to more communicated safety, and increases predictability through the reduction of interagent tension that otherwise might activate coping as fallback. Co-creating agents should become aware of the needs of others and what comes naturally to themselves, others with similar needs, others with different needs, and the wider habitat’s dynamics. They have to optimize all in the context of everything else and over all timescales (we referred to this as ‘pervasive optimization’, Andringa et al., 2015), which is a direct reference to Sternberg’s definition of wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The application of tacit knowledge towards the application of a common good through a balance among intra-, inter-, and extra- personal interests to achieve a balance among adaptation to existing environments, shaping of existing environments, and a selection of new environments, over the long term as well as the short term. <br> -– Sternberg (1998)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition is somewhat human-centered and can easily be generalized to all life, all agentic interests, all habitats, and all time-scales. And since tacit knowledge refers to skills, Sternberg’s definition can be generalized to <em>“the balancing skills to contribute to the biosphere.”</em> This is what we refer to as <strong>generalized wisdom</strong>.</p>
<p>Where the application of power generally (but not necessarily) produces benefits to an in-group at the detriment of out-groups, proper co-creation leads to broadly constructive benefits and is a more than zero-sum game. As we argued, this drove and arguably still drives biospheric growth. Note that many agents might still suffer; co-creation manifests broad net benefits, not the absence of harm or suffering. Typically co-creating agents form a <strong>community,</strong> a group of individuals that each freely and self-guidedly contribute whatever benefits their adequacy can bring.</p>
<p>Co-creating agents need to act on what comes naturally to agents and habitats. They must learn how to promote more natural behavior and prevent behavior leading to broadly detrimental consequences. The Daoist key term ‘<strong>Wu Wei</strong>,’ reflects this since it “<em>means something like ‘act naturally,’ ‘effortless action,’ or ‘nonwillful action’</em>” (Littlejohn, 2003). Characteristically, it completely misses the urgency of coping strategies and the effort associated with exercising power. Wu Wei is also a way to be authoritative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… individuals emerge authoritative and powerful as part and parcel of an interconnected web of forces. Therefore, a crucial back-and-forth tug between the self and the various influences and authorities surrounding it is woven in the very fabric of what it means to be a fully attained and empowered individual. <br>-–(Brindley, 2010, pp. xxvii–xxviii).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wu Wei is a quite different conception of authority since it does not pertain to realizing specific intended results, but instead is aimed at pervasive optimization (Andringa et al., 2015) and becoming “a fully attained and empowered individual” as “part and parcel of an interconnected web of forces”; what Maslow (1954) refers to as self-actualization. It is this growth process that drives identity development, as much as it promotes general well-being.</p>
<p>Co-creation expresses and relies on highly skilled behaviors of many <strong>responsible autonomous</strong> individuals who adapt to and use the possibilities of changing situations. As such it is not easy to maintain and somewhat fragile; the highest co-creative quality is difficult to maintain and generally transitory. This is quite different for coping that relies on more basic strategies like mimicry and rule-following and that can be both stable and stultifying.</p>
<h2 id="two-ontologies">Two ontologies</h2>
<p>The complementary properties and behavioral logic of coping and co-creation lead often to opposing strategies. Both aim to increase habitat predictability. Coping does that via imposing behavioral constraints and habitat control to counteract adequacy limits. Co-creation instead promotes the creation of a never-stable network of behaviors that come naturally and unconstrained and that distribute the responsibility for habitat viability over all contributing agents. Implicitly this assumes that participants are willing and able to alleviate their adequacy limits and grow in their ability to co-create.</p>
<p>Coping and co-creation are both essential. But successful coping is short lasting and effective, it ends the cause for its activation and restores co-creation as behavioral default. Unsuccessful coping is ineffective, and hence prolonged. And since the causes for its activation remain valid, it precludes co-creation. This entails that individuals who predominantly cope or co-create develop quite different worldviews, strategies, values, and identities. Hence, they might not be able to understand one another or to collaborate effectively.</p>
<p>Table 2 shows the two separate ontologies of coping and co-creation. It organizes and relates the concepts within each ontology through matching them to complimentary concepts and/or roles in the other ontology. That we are able to do that on a consistent basis, suggests not only the structural differences between coping and co-creation, but also that we are uncovering some basic tenets of life and cognition.</p>
<p>We consider the selection, matching, and precise formulation of these concepts an ongoing process. Hence, its formulations will develop over time; the formulation in the table is our current best.</p>
<p>In part 2 of this paper we apply and extend the proposed framework to identity development and we apply it on a metatheoretical level to two approaches to general well-being. Ontological security as manifestation of coping and psychological safety as manifestation of co-creation. This leads to the extension of both tables and an improved definition of co-creation and the two ontologies that comprise it.</p>

            <p>The properties of the coping and the co-creation reflect a close relationship to the properties of the left and the right brain hemispheres as described by McGilchrist in his book &ldquo;The Master and his Emissary&rdquo;. Here we derive those properties from the &ldquo;edge of chaos&rdquo;. Coping promotes structure, co-creation promotes opportunity. </p>
          </a>
          <div style="display:none !important">
                <p>This is a slightly extended version of <strong>Example 1</strong> of the usefulness of the concept of core cognition that we gave of in the application section called &ldquo;Human Cognition from Life&rdquo; in our 2015 paper called <a href="/pdf/Cognition-from-life-Andringa_2015.pdf">Cognition from Life</a> (page 11). It develops a connection with Iain McGilchrist&rsquo;s seminal work on the divide brain.</p>
<p><strong>Two Attitudes Toward the World and Two Brain Hemispheres</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="/pdf/Learning-Autonomy-Andringa_2013.pdf">Learning Autonomy</a> (Andringa et al., 2013) we observed that <em>successful</em> life span development is characterized by an ever-improving understanding of reality in combination with an urge (and proven ability) to improve and shape the Umwelt. This fits the description of the co-creation mode that we coupled to the “prevention of problems, consolidation after repletion, and – as much as possible – the creation and maintenance of a safe and sustaining environment with long-term need satisfaction potential.” In Learning Autonomy we interpreted cognitive development (in humans and human-like artificial agents) as learning to master the complexity of the world.</p>
<p>Life is always near the ‘edge of chaos’ (Mora and Bialek, 2011) and if the complexity of the current situation is judged too high we benefit from coping strategies that reduce its complexity and make the situation more tractable and predictable. In <a href="/pdf/Learning-Autonomy-Andringa_2013.pdf">Learning Autonomy</a> we referred to the form of cognition that allows us to curtail a complex world as “cognition for order,” “cognition for certainty,” or “control cognition.” We associated this form of cognition with fear and anxiety, detachment, abstract manipulation, and the personality trait ‘closed to experience.’ This description matches with the concepts that we used to describe the coping mode: ‘trying to control the situation,’ ‘reactive problem solving,’ ‘conservation of the essential,’ ‘short-term utility for self-preservation,’ and ‘acceptance of adverse side effects.’</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yet at other moments we can deal with some additional complexity and allow ourselves to explore the possibilities of the world. Successful, typically playful and purposeless, exploration leads to the discovery of new, generic or invariant structures that make the world a bit more tractable and accessible to agentic influences. This expansion of the understanding of the world fits with the holistic nature of the co-creation mode.</p>
<p>In Learning Autonomy we observed that the two modes we identified matched the description of differences in the way the left and right cerebral hemispheres understand the world and contribute to our existence according to the seminal work “The Master and His Emissary” by McGilchrist (2010). Table 1 of Learning Autonomy provides an comprehensive summary of the reported differences between (and complementarity of) the atti- tudes toward the world associated with the left and the right hemispheres that exemplifies how the coping and the co-creation modes are implemented in modern humanity (and in particular the brains of human individuals).</p>
<p>McGilchrist (2010) argues that our Western societies have become characterized by an ever growing dominance of the left-hemispheric – coping – world-view that favors a narrow focus over the broader picture, specialists over generalists, fragmentation over unification, knowledge and intelligence over experience and wisdom, technical objects over living entities, control over growth and flourishing, and dependence over autonomy. Apparently, despite the huge cultural progress that has been made in the last millennia, humanity shifted more and more toward the coping mode. According to the summary in <strong>Figure 1</strong> this is a neither a sign of autopoietic success, nor of viability: on the contrary. Apparently, our understanding of society has not matched society’s complexity growth.</p>
<p>This erosion of the co-creation mode of cognition, and, directly coupled, the resilience reduction of our natural environment, may in fact explain why humanity faces a number of existential problems and in particular has difficulties in realizing a sustainable long-term future: the coping mode, with a focus on pressing problems, intolerance to diversity, and its insensitivity to adverse side-effects as key characteristics, is simply unsuitable to setup the conditions for easy and reliable future need satisfaction.</p>
<p>In McGilchrist&rsquo;s formulation the right hemisphere is the master and the left hemisphere the servant to be assigned with specific tasks.</p>
<p><img src="/images/two-half-brains.jpg" alt="Escher Liberation Infographics" title="Escher Liberation Infographics"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are usually unaware of the switch between coping and co-creation, or alternatively of the switch between the strategies and outlook of our left and right hemisphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the core cognition framework the switch is one between cognition for control, order, certainty, and utility essential when the stakes are high, and cognition for exploration, disorder, possibility, and engagement.</p>

<p>Authors: Tjeerd C. Andringa</p>
<p>This paper is about the highest form of mental health attainable: self-actualization. It is not a repetition of what Maslow has said about the topic. Quite on the contrary; it is a more or less independent derivation of the concept of complete mental health and full mental development that validates all Maslow&rsquo;s insights while providing a scientific foundation.</p>
<p>Maslow was spot on with his description of self-actualization, but he derived this via an intuitive process of little scientific rigor. Most scientific breakthroughs start this way. This paper is an serious, but fairly accessible, underpinning of his intuitions.</p>
<h2 id="self-actualizing-what-is-it">Self-actualizing: what is it?</h2>
<h3 id="cognition-from-first-principles">Cognition from first principles</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a psychologist. I&rsquo;m a systems thinker. In particular, I study systems that take responsibility for their own continued existence: <em>living agents</em>. Agents who are very good at that self-actualize. And they prove that through tell-tale characteristics of flourishing. For me self-actualization is not at all a human specific property. In fact, modern humans might not even be very good at it, since many are rather languishing or suffering than flourishing (Keyes, 2005).</p>
<p>In previous papers I have described the demands of survival and flourishing in abstract and general terms that I refer to as core cognition. Core cognition is the cognition that, we postulate, is shared by all of life. With core cognition we derived the requirements of optimal agentic behavior from first principles (Andringa et al., 2015) and with that we can derive the foundations of much of (human) cognition. This gives me a broadly informed and often unique perspective on self-actualization.</p>
<p>In a two-part paper (Andringa &amp; Denham, 2021; Denham &amp; Andringa, 2021, <a href="https://corecognition.com/pdf/CoreCognition-Andringa-Denhan-2021.pdf">here the combined pdf</a>) we derived the structure of identity from first principles (namely the defining properties of life) and we have also demonstrated that some good intentioned efforts to improve society and its members are doomed to end in a state of pathological normality that is far from self-actualization.</p>
<p>Before that, we (Andringa et al, 2015, <a href="https://corecognition.com/pdf/Cognition_from_life_Andringa-2015.pdf">pdf</a>) derived 1) the basis for the differences between the brain hemispheres, 2) why the brain has and needs two complementary systems, 3) how power and intelligence serve to prevent an ill-understood world from spinning out of control while understanding and wisdom allow the co-creation of a world in which most problem are prevented. 4) how unicellular cooperation rules explain value differences between US liberals and conservatives, and 5) why positive emotions are the basis for personal and mental growth.</p>
<p>In an older paper on open-ended development called &ldquo;learning autonomy&rdquo; (Andringa et al., 2013, <a href="https://corecognition.com/pdf/Learning-autonomy_Andringa_2013.pdf">pdf</a>) we had laid much of the groundwork by identifying two modes of thought: what we now refer to as coping and co-creation. Using Escher&rsquo;s tessellation &ldquo;Liberation&rdquo;, we showed that coping was actually described by Abraham Maslow as deficiency cognition (D-cognition).</p>
<p>In that paper we described it as cognition for control, certainty, and order since its aim is to realize or restore more manageable conditions to live in (which it may or may not be realistic). We also identified a complementary mode of cognition: cognition for exploration, disorder, possibility, which we now refer to as co-creation. Again Maslow had already described this as being cognition (D-cognition) and he had identified that as the characteristic cognition of self-actualizers.</p>
<h3 id="deficiency-cognitioncoping">Deficiency-cognition/coping</h3>
<p>D-cognition/coping is always associated with a perceived lack of safety and an associated fear of not being able to cope with the situation: it is activated by <em>problems</em>. At the basis, coping aims to realize a less complex world and hence it relies on the various manifestations of social mimicry that all promote <em>oneness and sameness</em>.</p>
<p>Social mimicry can be simple copying of seemingly successful, authoritative or charismatic individuals, but it can also be more indirect via adherence to norms, customs, traditions, rules, checklists, role-models, procedures, ideologies, and laws.</p>
<p>Individuals who express coping do so from a deep and strong (yet mostly unconscious) anxiety to retain or regain control over their lives by imposing a sharable (averaged, static, abstract, predictable) order on the behaviors of self and others. The coping mode&rsquo;s social motto is: &ldquo;We are right and you have to adapt your behavior to match ours.&rdquo; We call this the authoritarian motto.</p>
<p>It is strongly related to Stenner&rsquo;s (2005) Authoritarian Dynamic: &ldquo;Intolerance to diversity = authoritarianism x threat level&rdquo;. Where authoritarianism is a measure of reliance on coping. So the authoritarian dynamic says that the more individuals (and groups) rely on coping and the higher the threat level, the more intolerant to diversity they become.</p>

<h3 id="being-cognitionco-creation">Being-cognition/co-creation</h3>
<p>B-cognition/co-creation complements coping through using the <em>possibilities</em> of the world to add value to the habitat. Where coping aims to solve or otherwise address or suppress problems in standardized or concerted efforts, co-creation success entails the self-directed prevention of problems by reducing barriers to optimal functioning or by finding new ways to realize even better quality of life. We identified the associated continual optimization process as &ldquo;<em>pervasive optimization</em>&quot;: optimizing everything in the context of everything else.</p>
<p>Unlike coping that has specific success states – satisfied or mitigated deficiencies, and more sameness and oneness – co-creation has no definite success states. There are countless ways to realize high quality of life and there is no simple metric to favor one above the other. Where coping relies on social mimicry and the associated reduction of behavioral diversity, co-creation depends on countless self-initiated and unscripted contributions to the world that both increase diversity and quality of life.</p>
<p>We argued that this description of co-creation pertains to all of life and in fact drove the growth of the biosphere in the last 3.8 billion years (Andringa et al, 2015). This is self-actualization on a biosphere level. In fact the biosphere can be interpreted as &ldquo;Life self-actualizing&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="coping-and-co-creation-success-and-failure">Coping and co-creation: success and failure.</h3>
<p>While Maslow clearly indicated that being-cognition required deficiency-needs to be sufficiently satisfied, he did not say much about the interplay between being-cognition and deficiency cognition. The interplay was in part elucidated by Iain McGilchrist in his book <a href="https://channelmcgilchrist.com/the-master-his-emissary-book/">&ldquo;The master and his emissary&rdquo;</a> (2010) that describes the two complementary outlooks-to-the-the-world of our two brain hemispheres.</p>
<p>His extremely rich and detailed description of these two outlooks (see table 2 of <a href="https://corecognition.com/pdf/Learning-autonomy_Andringa_2013.pdf">Andringa et al. 2013</a>) is yet another manifestation of the complementarity of d-cognition/coping and b-cognition/co-creation and he connects this to culture and philosophy.</p>
<p>McGilchrist describes the right hemisphere as the master who tasks the left hemisphere, the emissary, with specific assignments. Problems arise when the emissary, with its characteristic narrow-minded focus, high urgency, and minimal self-reflective abilities takes the master&rsquo;s role. McGilchrist blames many of society&rsquo;s problems, backed-up with many historical examples, on the left hemisphere (LH) taking control over matters it is much less competent at than a well-functioning right hemisphere (RH).</p>
<p>We  proposed that co-creation (RM) is the natural default mode that is activated in the absence of perceived pressing problems (Andringa et a., 2015; Andringa and Denham, 2021). The coping mode is activated when a situation is deemed problematic (or more generally, benefits from problem solving or focus on detail).</p>
<p>Successful co-creation means prevented pressing problems and flourishing. Its failure leads to unprevented pressing problems. Likewise, successful coping leads to solved problems, while unsuccessful problem solving to perpetuated or new problems. Life success requires therefore both high co-creation skills to prevent problems and high coping skills to address and solve the problems that could not be prevented.</p>
<p>In general low co-creation skills lead to many unprevented problems and low coping skills lead to unsolved or new problems. We refer to an (in part) self-perpetuated situation of continued problems – that keep activating the coping mode – as a coping trap. This is one state of (deeply) suboptimal mental health.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Key dynamics of core cognition. Concepts in white help to realize and protect high viability and are associated with self-avtualization. Concepts in black pertain to coping</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="so-what-is-complete-mental-health">So what is complete mental health?</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization&rsquo;s'  formulated &lsquo;health&rsquo; in 1948 as ‘ <em>A state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity</em> ’. Huber (2011) introduced a new concept of health as ‘ <em>The ability to adapt and to self-manage, in the face of social, physical and emotional challenges</em> ’. Huber&rsquo;s definition focuses on autonomy: if you are able to face social, physical and emotional challenges, then you are healthy, even in the presence of clear symptoms like obesity, anxiety, or an amputation. On the other hand the WHO&rsquo;s definition demands complete physical, mental, social wellbeing, well above the level of absence of symptoms.</p>
<p>Maslow&rsquo;s definition of self-actualization as <em>complete</em> mental health is a combination of the key features of both: it is <em>&ldquo;complete mental and social wellbeing through the ability to adapt and self-manage in the face of social and emotional challenges</em>&rdquo;. Complete mental health is self-generated and self-maintained and expresses the skills to prevent most problems and effectively solve or otherwise address those that cannot be prevented.</p>
<p>A completely mentally healthy individual expresses being-cognition and co-creation adequacy most of the time and especially to guide long-term or strategic behaviors. Deficiency-cognition and coping is expressed only as short and effective temporary fallback. Self-actualizers therefore successfully maximize the fraction of their life-time co-creating.</p>
<p>This also dovetails with DiPaolo&rsquo;s (2014) definition of cognitivity. He writes “A system is cognitive when its behavior is governed by the norm of the system’s own continued existence and flourishing”. The more a cognitive system flourishes, the higher its viability, the further it is from death, the less it is restrained by problems, the more it co-creates and expresses being-cognition, and the more it self-actualizes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/agentic-success.gif" alt="Agentic Success" title="Agentic Success"></p>
<p>Because <em>self-actualization</em> describes complete mental health, it is a health extreme: only a minority (a few percent, depending on the strictness of the definition) of the population manifests and expresses a dominance of co-creation in combination with very effective coping. Formulated like this self-actualization is the <em>skill</em> to prevent most problems and effectively solve or otherwise address those that cannot be prevented.</p>
<h2 id="developing-highly-realistic-worldviews">Developing highly realistic worldviews</h2>
<p>Skilled actors realize intended and beneficial outcomes, the unskilled do not or even cause harm. Skillful behavior proves proves a high congruence between intention and outcome and hence realistic expectations. Self-actualizers are very skilled in living and hence prove in the vast majority of their actions they generated realistic expectations: they have created a realistic worldview.</p>
<p>Physical reality, for all its intricacies and complications, is completely self-consistent: physical reality is always in states that follow strictly causally from previous states. This makes physical predictable. This predictability is the key prerequisite of skilled behavior and knowledge in general. Living agents base their very existence on the causal nature of reality.</p>
<p>The more pervasively one can predict the outcomes of one&rsquo;s interactions with the world, the more often these work out as intended. This is what we refer to as a realistic world-view: a resource to generate realistic expectations of interaction with the full breadth of reality. A highly realistic world-view both characterizes and enables self-actualization. And self-actualizers have created that in a uniquely individual process.</p>
<p>In Learning Autonomy (Andringa et al., 2013) we described three phases of which the third  depends on the successful mastering of phase 2. In phase 1 the agent  learns to master the body. Phase 2 aims to make the mind into a reliable tool. Preconditioned on success in phase 2, phase 3 aims to effectively co-create a highly viable interaction between habitat and self. Phase 2 involves the acquisition the huge body of shared knowledge about the physical, the living, and the cultural world that we derive typically from all forms of social mimicking.</p>
<p>Only if this body of knowledge is sufficiently functional and broadly applicable, one can start to rely on it to engage in truly self-directed endeavors. So only when self-direction provides a net benefit, individuals have access to phase 3: the phase of self-actualization and full human autonomy. We provided a lot of converging evidence for this.</p>
<p>The problem with phase 2 knowledge is that it involves the adoption of shared and consensually adopted knowledge from teachers and peers, a process that Maslow calls enculturation. Knowledge acquired this way is mostly correct and functional and its application is effective in the Pareto sense: you can derive say 80% of the benefit by acquiring this knowledge, but to reach optimal or even correct results you need additional experience to refine the knowledge and to apply it safely in realistic contexts.</p>
<p>This refinement is not only a process that takes considerably longer, it is also a strictly private mental process: one in which you have to learn to trust your mental refinement abilities. And while you learn to trust your own decision and sense making, you develop your own unique and better than average worldview. If you do not, you have to fall back to a mostly consensual shared worldview with lower effectiveness.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;switch&rdquo; from shared, explicit and consensual knowledge to ever more individual, implicit, and self-constructed knowledge determines phase 2 success and gives access to phase 3 and (potential) self-actualization. In McGilchrist&rsquo;s terminology this corresponds to a shift from left hemispheric dominance to a gradually more prominent role of the right hemisphere and, self-actualization to its dominance.</p>
<p>It also corresponds to a change from memorization via social mimicry, characteristic of coping, to the self-construction of knowledge (on a basis of shared knowledge) and self-direction. It is a switch from cognition for control, order, certainty, and utility to cognition for exploration, disorder, possibility, and engagement. And it is also a switch from reliance on external authority to self-direction (the internalization of the authority role).</p>
<p><img src="/images/deep-switch.jpg" alt="Deep Switch illustration" title="Deep switch"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The deep switch&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;The deep switch signifies the gradually growing reliance on self-constructed knowledge and strategies that at the same time signifies a change from cognition for control, order, certainty, and utility via social mimicry to cognition for exploration, disorder, possibility, and self-guided engagement via the self-construction of knowledge and strategies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &ldquo;deep switch&rdquo; is a precondition for self-actualization and full mental health. Without making the switch you are limited to the domain of shared consensual knowledge. Depending on the quality of the contributions to the shared knowledge domain its quality can range from totally dysfunctional and toxic to fairly reliable and empowering.</p>
<p>In fact the historian Quigley (1961) claims that the statement &ldquo;Truth unfolds through a communal process&rdquo; lies at the foundation of Western culture. Western society has indeed created much valuable knowledge. It also created a lot of knowledge, data, and opinions of questionable utility and unrealistic and unproductive nonsense. These pollute the shared societal narrative and degrade its utility and reliability. Of course, the more dysfunctional the shared narrative, the more difficult it will be to protect against the adoption of disempowering data, ideas, and opinions. I refer to the process of getting rid of this as <em>weeding out toxic enculturation</em>.</p>
<h3 id="weeding-out-toxic-enculturation">Weeding out toxic enculturation</h3>
<p>Phase 2 depends by and large on copying the behaviors, ideas, strategies, opinions, and talking-points of others: social mimicry. If successful, this is a stepping stone towards the more advanced behaviors in phase 3. For this aspiring self-actualizers need to learn the mental habits to weed &lsquo;toxic enculturation&rsquo; because this causes or prolongs problems when relied on and effectively reduces the life-fraction co-creating. And with that it reduces one&rsquo;s autonomy hence locks one in phase 2.</p>
<p>Self-actualizers prove they succeeded in weeding out the knowledge items and inconsistencies in their worldview with a dominant co-creation mode. Non-self-actualizers suffer from toxic knowledge items and a generally inconsistent world-view that prevent them to consistently reach the higher levels of self-maintained viability and locks them in the coping mode.</p>
<p>This is a process in which (system 2 and system 1) [bullets are draft]</p>
<ul>
<li>RH presents the world and activates relevant context.</li>
<li>LH looks for logical errors and inconsistencies and proposes, if need be, improvements</li>
<li>RH evaluates the improvements in the larger context of one&rsquo;s worldview</li>
<li>RH + LH when local logical structure and global worldview context is no longer in conflict an improved and more consistent context-embedded memory trace of the knowledge item is stored for future use.</li>
<li>This becomes habitual</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a mind that has learned to improve his own thoughts by critical examining them. This is a well-studied and documented process,</p>
<h3 id="the-educated-mind-and-the-informational-identity-style">The educated mind and the informational identity style</h3>
<p>Perry (1998), who studied epistemological development in adolescents (in his case Harvard students) has described the associated mindful engagement when he described the features of the educated mind. He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The educated mind has learned to think about even his own thoughts, it examines the way it orders his data and the assumptions it is making, it compares these with other thoughts that other people might have and adopts whatever this scrutiny of data, ideas, and opinions decides on as most reliable and productive.</p>
<p>In doing so the educated mind learned to think in accordance with reality from which position he can take responsibility for his own stand and negotiate – with respect – with others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key point here is that an educated mind self-examines data, ideas, and opinions and replaces these with ever more reliable and productive variants. This habit to make one&rsquo;s data, ideas, and opinions ever more reliable and productive is not only the process that weeds out toxic enculturation in internal inconsistencies between knowledge items, it is also the driver of self-actualization.</p>
<p>Note that nothing in this definition requires formal education. Formal education might even impede the deep switch when learning focusses solely on the diverse forms of social mimicry (like complying with standardized learning outcomes) and the associated memorization at the cost of the self-construction of knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="the-achieved-identity">The achieved identity</h3>
<p>Weeding out unproductive and toxic knowledge items is also a characteristic of the <em>achieved identity style</em>. In identity research, the data, ideas, and opinions that one takes for true – one&rsquo;s worldview – is referred to as self-relevant information. It is self-relevant because what we take as reliable and productive becomes part of our identity or self-theory. Identity can be defined as &ldquo;a theory of me as actor in the world&rdquo; or &ldquo;self-theory&rdquo; (Berzonsky, 1992): how you define yourself determines how you engage the world. Berzonsky (1992), writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The effectiveness of this identity structure or self-theory depends on its pragmatic utility: Does it enable individuals to cope successfully with the stressors and personal problems that are encountered in everyday life? As contextual demands change and new situations are encountered, continued personal effectiveness will depend on the way in which the identity structure or self-theory is revised or conserved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self-actualizers know that their set of self-relevant information – their worldview – can and should be improved by identifying and repairing errors, inconsistencies, and missing data and hence they welcome (high quality) information that is &ldquo;dissonant&rdquo; (conflicting) with their current world-view because it challenges them to reduce the conflict between their current worldview and potential improvements derived from different perspectives on reality. This find this process also quite pleasurable.</p>
<p>Identity research calls this the informational identity style. This attitude towards information is, as one would expect of something essential to self-actualization, predictive of many aspects of their being.  Berzonsky (2011) summarizes the informational identity style as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals with an informational style deliberately search out,  process, and  evaluate self-relevant  information  before resolving identity conflicts and forming commitments. They are self-reflective, skeptical about their self-views, interested in learning new things about themselves, and willing to evaluate and modify their identity structure in light of dissonant feedback. Research indicates that an informational style is associated with self-insight, open-mindedness, problem-focused coping strategies, vigilant decision making, cognitive complexity, emotional autonomy, empathy, adaptive self-regulation, high commitment levels, and an achieved identity status. Individuals with high informational scores tend to define themselves in terms of personal attributes such as personal values, goals, and standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This description points to an aspect that has not yet been focused on: <em>self-actualizers self-manage personal growth to meet the challenges of changing circumstances</em> (&ldquo;problem-focused coping&rdquo;, &ldquo;modify their identity structure&rdquo;, and &ldquo;adaptive self-regulation&rdquo;). To do so they need to be &ldquo;self-reflective, skeptical about their self-views, interested in learning new things about themselves, and willing to evaluate and modify their identity structure in light of dissonant feedback&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Both the description of the educated mind and the informational style rely on a combination of strong co-creation and coping skills with co-creation and the associated enlargement of behavioral repertoire in the lead and coping as an effective fallback.</p>
<h3 id="identity-achieved-prerequisite-to-self-actualization">Identity achieved: prerequisite to self-actualization</h3>
<p>Self-actualizers are a subpopulation of identity achievement. Individuals with and achieved identity have experienced a period of self-exploration in which they learned to weed out toxic enculturation, where they developed and learned to trust a personal world-view that allows them to (mostly) think and act in accordance with reality.</p>
<p>They have skills and strategies that work reliably and hence do not have to be changed. It seems as if they have committed to particular life courses. But these commitments are not so much a deliberate choice, as  a set of reliable and broadly beneficial personal strategies that they continually build on and hence value highly and protect.</p>
<p>The more they self-construct their personal sphere of influence, the more they prevent problems (co-creation) and the more effectively and quickly they address the ones that cannot be avoided, the more they self-actualize. An achieved identity style is indeed a prerequisite to self-actualization.</p>
<h3 id="self-actualizing-what-it-is">Self-actualizing: what it is</h3>
<p>This then concludes the first part&quot;Self-actualization: what is it?&rdquo;. Self-actualization is not only near optimal mental health, it is as much a form of optimal living. And this form of optimal living is preconditioned on developing a realistic worldview.</p>
<p>Self-actualization has a number of tell-tale indicators.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dominant co-creation (being-cognition) and effective coping (deficiency cognition)</li>
<li>Informational identity style: self-actualizers are self-critical and use dissonant information and any source of skills to improve all aspects of their worldview and skill set.</li>
<li>Trust in self-constructed knowledge and self-directing one&rsquo;s behaviors. Self-actualizers have made the deep switch from behavior based on social mimicry to self-direction.</li>
<li>High sense of realism: self-actualizer have liberated themselves by and large from toxic enculturation and made their worldview consistent. This allows them tom detect the fake and inconsistent and engage in endeavors that are likely to produce intended outcomes.</li>
<li>Effectively building on previous activities: self-actualizers contribute to the world via the constructive traces that they leave in the world on which they and others can build.</li>
<li>They self-manage personal growth to match the demands of changing circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next part, full mental health will become more meaningful by contrasting it with different forms of existence that fall short of it.</p>
<h2 id="self-actualizing-what-it-is-not">Self-actualizing: what it is not</h2>
<p>What self-actualizing is will become even clearer by contrasting it to behavioral patterns that are deemed quite normal – and are often the norm – and not normally indicative of sub-optimal mental health. I do this using the structure of identity as has been elucidated in the last 50 years.</p>
<h3 id="the-structure-of-identity">The structure of identity</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the structure of identity development is depicted in four quadrants. The achieved identity style, including the self-actualizers, is one quadrant. The other quadrants are referred to as the moratorium, the foreclosed, and the diffusive identity style. Self-actualizers engage in characteristic mental and identity development processes. Non-self-actualizer are either:</p>
<ol>
<li>still in the process (moratoria),</li>
<li>have avoided the weeding out of toxic enculturation (foreclosures), or</li>
<li>actively resist the mental and identity development processes (diffusions).</li>
</ol>
<p>The four quadrants arise from the interaction of two axes. One axis denotes self-exploration or not. And the second axis firm commitments or not. Self-actualizers are are committed self-explorers.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation (societal, social, physical, physiological) everyone can adopt strategies characteristic of each quadrant. Yet in the context of normal life, we tend to be dominated by behaviors characteristic of one of the quadrants: our identity style (Berzonsky, 1992). In addition, there is a natural life-course development towards self-exploration and commitments. This development can however stall indefinitely if for example the deep switch is avoided or never completed.</p>
<p>In part 2 of our recent paper (Denham &amp; Andringa, 2021) we outlined the deep relation between coping and co-creation adequacy and the structure of identity (Denham &amp; Andringa, 2021). We summarized this in a somewhat complicated figure centered around four strategies to deal with life&rsquo;s strategies: <em>preventing, solving, controlling, and avoiding</em> problems. The different identity styles rely on different combinations of these, which to a large extend explains the clear differences between the identity styles.</p>
<p><img src="https://socioemotional.weebly.com/uploads/4/9/9/7/49975819/1430941471.png" alt="Picture"></p>
<h3 id="identity-moratorium-stalled-problem-solving-abilities">Identity moratorium: stalled problem solving abilities</h3>
<p>Individuals with the moratorium identity resemble achievers in many respects. Yet they differ characteristically in the absence of stable commitments. Moratoria clearly engage in self-exploration and weed out some toxic enculturation. So they clearly prefer co-creation over coping. But compared to achievers they have lower coping skills, which entails that many problems and situations are not efficiently dealt with and hence linger.</p>
<p>Where problems activate achievers to deal with them quickly and effectively, moratoria tend to avoid them. This makes sense given their low coping skills, but it deprives them of opportunities to develop these and assert themselves with constructive solutions. Without effective coping, they have no way to execute their strategies optimally and they cannot to protect these in times of adversity.</p>
<p>This makes it impossible to execute stable strategies (commit) and instead adapt to circumstances, rather that grow to match the new challenges as achievers do. As preferred co-creators they explore a lot and engage actively with the diversity of the world. Yet this barely leads to the stable life-strategies – commitments – characteristic of achievers.</p>
<p>In addition, low coping skills keep a background of problems active and hence the coping mode is more often active than in achievers. This holds especially in times of anxiety, trouble, and uncertainty, where they can easily fall back to one of the other identity styles.</p>
<p>At the same time their low coping skills make them prefer comfort and restoration even more than others because it allows them to avoid or restore from their background problems. At the same time their co-creation skills make them fairly good in preventing problems. The combination of broad co-creation skills and a lack of high effectiveness inspires them to co-create a world in which they are less likely to be confronted with their own coping inadequacies.</p>
<p>Moratoria are in the process of making the deep switch. They switch between co-creation and coping most clearly of all identity styles. They prefer co-creation and self-exploration, but as weak copers they are unable to quickly end the problems they are faced with. This entails that they have not yet developed the reliance on self-constructed knowledge and strategies. In easy times they do, in difficult times they fall back to coping and social mimicry; in which case they behave like foreclosures or diffusions. In this case they become intolerant to diversity and prevent the personal growth that might allow them to cope better with circumstances. This is the authoritarian dynamic (Stenner, 2005) at work.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, they tend to understand the basics of self-actualization and find it highly desirable. At the same time they find the path towards it quite elusive.</p>
<h3 id="foreclosed-identity-adoption-of-shared-norms">Foreclosed identity: adoption of shared norms</h3>
<p>[This part is repetitive]</p>
<p>The identity style that conflicts most with self-actualization is the foreclosed identity. And that is not because they are furthest away from self-actualization (which is the diffusive identity), but because of an exclusive reliance on coping, which actively forecloses self-actualization by suppressing all &lsquo;dissonant information&rsquo; through a near exclusive reliance on social mimicry: rule following, procedures, traditions, checklists, ideologies, authority supported narratives, and consensually derived shared knowledge,</p>
<p>On a group level foreclosures are effective copers, but as individuals and groups they are ineffective co-creators. Ineffective co-creation (problem prevention) in combination with unaddressed toxic enculturation entails that foreclosed individuals and their in-group live in a world of structurally unprevented problems. Their high coordinated – hence group-level – coping skills keep these problems usually at manageable levels, but this requires a constant effort to suppress undesired (read potentially unmanageable) diversity.</p>
<p>Because they live in a world of structurally unprevented problems, foreclosed individuals rely on coping because they continually feel a deep and strong (yet mostly unconscious) anxiety that motivated them to retain or regain control over their lives by imposing a sharable (averaged, static, abstract, predictable) order on the behaviors of self and others. Hence they apply the coping mode&rsquo;s social motto: &ldquo;We are right and you have to adapt your behavior to match ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This fits with the key strategies of foreclosures to deal with life&rsquo;s challenges: a combination of solving and suppressing problems. Promoting oneness and sameness can solve some problems, but intolerance to diversity ensures that solutions and improvements are not even considered and hence foreclosures maintain conditions far below optimal. Coping is for survival, not for flourishing.</p>
<p>Stenner (2005) calls potentially undesired diversity a &lsquo;normative threat&rsquo;: a threat to the normative order and the cohesion and proper functioning of the in-group. Foreclosed individuals insist on &ldquo;oneness and sameness&rdquo; in all strategies, opinions, data, habits, traditions, narratives, and beliefs on which the proper functioning of their in-group relies on. This insistence is not a polite wish, but an existential need since they simply no longer have the cognitive apparatus to deal with more effective and productive strategies that conflict with the in-group narrative.</p>
<p>And because of this, they tend to restore – individually, but typically in groups – in-group oneness and sameness first lovingly and if necessary ruthlessly. Any in-group, small or big, whether a cult, ideology, religion, political or sexual orientation, knowledge discipline, nation, cultural or informational subculture,  profession, or knowledge bubble, that functions according the logic of coping, promotes sameness and oneness by first identifying and later suppressing dissonant out-group influences. Even the main culture of a region can behave like this.</p>
<p>For foreclosures, commitments are the direct result of excluding out-group options and hence they have no choice other than to act in accordance with the worldview of their in-group. For foreclosures commitments are just expressions of the full and unchanged adoption of the in-group narrative and not of any true self-direction.</p>
<p>So they can commit to a certain in-group carrier path, in which one could them ambitious. And they try to be the best in-group member they can be. But this almost inevitably entails sacrificing individual needs. Burn-outs seem to be a typical manifestation of this when the brainstem, tasked with keeping the body functional, no longer accepts this neglect and shuts down all motivation to continue the neglect.</p>
<p>Individuals with a foreclosed identity have never engaged in serious and successful self-exploration, because they unquestionably adopted the norms, practices, and narratives of the in-group that they are committed  members of. They are fully enculturated in-group members who prevent themselves from weeding out the toxic cultural influences of their in-group. Because because if they so that would make them flawed in-group members.</p>
<p>Hence they not only self-censor urges and ideas that conflict with the shared narrative, they also insist that others do so. This entails that with respect to the core narrative of the in-group they tend to be fairly interchangeable, predictable, and de-individualized. This is social mimicry  successfully leading to more sameness and oneness. Whatever diversity exists does not conflict with the shared in-group narrative.</p>
<p>The term foreclosed {to rule out or prevent] is actually well chosen. They have not only prevented self-exploration through the mindless adoption of some in-group narrative, but they actively rule out and suppress many perfectly feasible improvements to self, group functioning, and the world if these do not fit in their ideology, narrative, or creed. They implement the authoritarians motto: &ldquo;We are right and you have to adapt your behavior to match ours&rdquo;.  And Stenner&rsquo;s (2005) Authoritarian Dynamic in the sense that their intolerance to diversity scales with the normative threat-level they perceive.</p>
<p>Associated with the foreclosed identity comes a specific attitude to information that is referred to as the normative identity style. Berzonsky (2011) describes this normative orientation as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals with a normative orientation internalize and adhere to goals, values, and prescriptions appropriated from significant others and referent groups  [in-groups] in a relatively automatic or mindless manner, that is, they make premature commitments without critical evaluation and deliberation. They have a low tolerance for ambiguity and a high need to maintain structure and cognitive closure. Individuals who adopt this protectionist approach function as dogmatic self-theorists whose primary goal is to conserve and maintain self-views and to guard against information that may threaten their “hard core” values and beliefs. This relatively automatic approach to self-construction is associated with a foreclosed identity status and should lead to a rigidly organized self-theory composed of change-resistant self-constructs. A normative orientation is associated with firm goals, commitments, and a definite sense of purpose, but a low tolerance for uncertainty and a strong desire for structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which all fits perfectly with the cognition for certainly, order, and control that we defined earlier. The a priori exclusion of dissonant out-group ideas in combination with a existential dependence on oneness and sameness entails that the shared narrative that unifies the in-group has few options to weed out unproductive, unreliable, or even toxic aspects.</p>
<p>In practice this entails that although the foreclosed individuals express full faith in the veracity of the shared narrative, ideology, or creed, there is no reason to assume that the veracity is any better or less dysfunctional that other in-group narratives. The focus on in-group sameness and oneness prevents that.</p>

<p>The fourth and last identity is referred to a as identity diffusion. This is the group of individuals with neither effective coping nor co-creation skills. Like foreclosures they avoided self-exploration (they very well know they might not like what they will find when they do). And like moratoria they avoid problems and hence miss opportunities to learn problem solution skills. As a consequence, diffusions live in a world of unprevented and unsolved problems that they perpetuate habitually. And without these skills and a clear self-theory they respond more than they plan and they have to explain their actions using an ad hoc theory that changes with the circumstances. They therefore show no commitments.</p>
<p>[Self-reflection, they do not like when they reflect, avoid it  hence learn little from from their tribulations: search for guidance, guru&rsquo;s, spiritual leaders, idols, role-models, to mimic. ]</p>
<p>Unlike foreclosed individuals who are effective in-group members, they try to fit in via all types of social mimicry, but often fail to do so with sufficient benefits to self. For example they might crave likes on social media, but dread the prospect of not receiving them. Since they do barely understand the world they live in, they cannot predict the consequences of their own actions and are often confronted with unexpected and unexplainable side-effects (that nevertheless receive some ad hoc explanation). Deep inside they know that they play a big part in perpetuation of their own problems and hence they have great difficulty in engaging in all that is not habitual. This manifests as procrastination, which eventually entails that circumstances rather than their own initiative decide on their life-course.</p>
<p>Yet despite this all,</p>
<p>Because the live in a world of unprevented and unsolved problems (a coping trap) they rey</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A diffuse-avoidant orientation involves a reluctance to confront and deal with identity conﬂicts and issues. If one procrastinates too long, actions and choices will be determined by situational demands and consequences. Such context-sensitive adjustments, however, are more likely to involve transient acts of behavioral or verbal compliance rather than stable, long-term structural revisions in the self-theory. This processing orientation, originally identiﬁed as a diffuse orientation  is postulated to be typical of individuals categorized as having a diffused identity status. When it became apparent that at least some strategic avoidance was involved, it was referred to as the diffuse/avoidant (confused and/or strategic) orientation. The term diffuse-avoidant (with a dash instead of a slash) currently is preferred because it denotes that the orientation involves more than a confused or fragmented self; it reﬂects strategic attempts to evade, or at least obscure, potentially negative self diagnostic information. Individuals with a diffuse-avoidant orientation adopt an ad hoc, situation-speciﬁc approach to self-theorizing, which should lead to a fragmented set of self-constructs with limited overall unity. They assume a present-oriented, self-serving perspective that highlights immediate rewards and social concerns, such as popularity and impressions tailored for others, when making choices and interpreting events. Diffuse-avoidance is positively associated with efforts to excuse or rationalize negative performances, self-handicapping behaviors, impression management, limited commitment, and an external locus of control.</p>

            <p>Here we develop the <strong>structure of identity</strong> in terms of coping and co-creation adequacy. This leads to an enriched understanding of the interplay between coping and co-creation, and it demonstrates that the conceptual language of core cognition is a productive lens for approaching a well-studied psychological phenomenon. </p>
          </a>
          <div style="display:none !important">
                <p>Previously (Andringa, van den Bosch, &amp; Wijermans, 2015) we have connected the existence of an individual’s unique identity to the self-maintenance of the living state. Here we develop the structure of identity in terms of coping and co-creation adequacy. This leads to an enriched understanding of the interplay between coping and co-creation, and it demonstrates that the conceptual language of core cognition is a productive lens for approaching a well-studied psychological phenomenon. What we describe here connects intimately to the different perspectives on the world that the two brain hemispheres, as described by McGilchrist (2012), produce: <em>i.e.,</em> that the left-hemisphere is strongly connected to coping and the right hemisphere to co-creation (Andringa et al., 2015). Editorial constraints prevent us from developing this concept here in detail.</p>
<h2 id="identity-development">Identity development</h2>
<p>Berzonsky (1989), quoting Epstein, describes <bold>identity</bold> as a self-generated <em>theory of me as an actor in the world</em>, or self-theory: an explanatory structure constructed to explain and plan one’s interactions with the world. It is the basis for understanding one’s position and role in the world and, hence, an expression of one’s <strong>worldview</strong> and <strong>agency</strong>. An adequate self-theory allows one to cope with life’s challenges and respond to opportunities. In return, these enrich one’s self-theory and worldview. A self-theory is therefore directly related to how one appraises the world, which links with the way the left and right hemispheres of the brain understand reality (McGilchrist, 2012). Berzonsky (1989) describes this self-theory thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a theory that the individual has unwittingly constructed about him- or herself as an experiencing, functional individual … it contains major postulate systems for the nature of the world, for the nature of the self, and their interaction. Like most theories, that self-theory is a conceptual tool for accomplishing a purpose. Major purposes are to optimize the pleasure/pain balance of the individual over the course of a lifetime … and to organize the data of experience in a manner that can be coped with effectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning to optimize the pain/pleasure balance fits very well with optimizing well-being of the self through self-development of a worldview and an adequate behavioral repertoire for coping and co-creation. According to Berzonsky, the effectiveness of a self-theory can be measured in terms of whether it helps <em>“to solve the personal problems it was constructed to handle [and …] serve as a framework within which experience and […] relevant information can be meaningfully organized and understood</em>” (1989). We refer to this (partial) effectiveness as (partial) <strong>adequacy</strong> (see <a href="/basics/1-lifes-defining-properties/#well-being-and-adequacy">section 1 &ldquo;Well-being and adequacy&rdquo;</a>) use that to derive the main structure of identity.</p>
<h2 id="identity-as-co-creation-and-coping-inadequacy">Identity as co-creation and coping (in)adequacy</h2>
<p><a href="/basics/1-lifes-defining-properties/#behavioral-repertoire-and-worldview"><em>Figure 2</em> in Section 1</a> described the development of an agent’s behavioral repertoire. In this section we adapt it towards how humans deal with life’s challenges and problems (and indirectly to identity research). In [Section 2](basics/2-coping-and-co-creation/) we described two main strategies to make the world more predictable and hence more manageable. <strong>Coping</strong> aims to make the world more predictable by reducing its complexity and creating systems (of agents or things) with more predictable behavior, thus bringing threats-to-self under control and promoting security. <strong>Co-creation</strong> makes the world more predictable by promoting unconstrained natural behavior and easy need satisfaction, through promoting and communicating efforts that facilitate and maintain habitat viability and overall safety. We defined a highly adequate agent as one that can <em>prevent</em> most problems, and quickly and effectively <em>solve</em> what cannot be prevented. Problems (and challenges) that cannot be prevented or solved can be controlled (suppressed) or avoided. These four strategies – preventing, solving, controlling, and avoiding – can be included in <a href="/basics/1-lifes-defining-properties/#behavioral-repertoire-and-worldview"><em>Figure 2</em> in Section 1</a> to yield <em>Figure 3</em> below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/life-challenges.gif" alt="Figure 3. Dealing with Life&rsquo;s challenges" title="Figure 3. Dealing with Life's challenges">
<em>Four attitudes toward problems and challenges (on the main axes), coupled with broad strategies (on the circle), effects on the world, and behavioral (in)effectiveness. The dashed arrows represent life’s key demands: maintaining and increasing viability of self and habitat (Part 1, Figure 1). Alternatively attending to both demands implements core cognition.<br></em></p>
<p>The main horizontal axis denotes preventing problems (associated with wisdom) as the highest manifestation of self-direction since it leads to high viability of self and habitat <a href="/images/need-satisfaction.gif"><em>Figure 1</em> in Section 1</a>). Its fallback strategy is controlling or reducing (unprevented) problems through social mimicry (Chartrand &amp; van Baaren, 2009) as a manifestation of low self-direction. This is a situation where persistent problems require great effort to handle but are not necessarily successfully controlled and signify low viability. The vertical axis reflects solving problems (associated with intelligence) as a way to assert oneself or, alternatively, avoid them as a way of adapting without changing the situation.</p>
<p>The four quadrants of <em>Figure 3</em> correspond directly to those in <em>Table 3 (see below)</em>, where the combination of attitudes towards problems and challenges define each of the four table entries that we are going to connect to matching identity statuses (indicated in brackets). In each quadrant we first give a short description in terms of adequacy, and secondly, we describe the associated worldview.</p>

<td><strong>Preventing &amp; Avoiding</strong> (Identity moratorium) <br> Agents aim to co-create or select a world where they are not inadequate because it promotes easy need satisfaction and unconstrained natural behavior. <br> They live in a world that they mostly understand and can handle, but tend to be bothered by long-term problems, which periodically surface, because they lack the skills to address them effectively. In addition, they are blind to the power of complexity reduction and control strategies.</td>

<center>Table 3. Identity as an expression of strategies to deal with life’s challenges. The four cells correspond to the quadrants of Figure 3.</center>
<p>In Table 3, the set of behaviors still pertains mainly to general agents, since we limited ourselves to the generalized concepts and formulations derived in Part 1. In the next sections we will introduce, first, the defining two dimensions of the human identity concept, and secondly, we will describe each of the four described identity statuses in relation to what we outlined in Table 3.</p>
<p>The modern identity concept
James Marcia (1967) described late-adolescent development in terms of a transition from “the given” (the dependent) to the (independent) “givers,” and an identity (development) crisis. He described (1966) four identity statuses as combinations of high and low scores on two dimensions: stable commitments and (to use a modern formulation) deliberate self-exploration.</p>
<p>Stable commitments indicate that personal strategies are effective and, hence, that one can build – self-directedly – on traces left in the habitat (which is related to concepts like stigmergy and authority). Since effective strategies are further improved through experience, they do not have to be replaced. This leads to stable, albeit developing, life-strategies and a stable, and effective personality. In Figure 2 of Part 1, this corresponded to an “upward'' move towards a more effective behavioral repertoire.</p>
<p>Deliberate self-exploration and the development of a self-constructed theory of me as an actor in the world is a requirement for the development of a unique self, rather than an identity based on values and beliefs adopted uncritically and unchanged from others (mimicking). The process of deliberate exploration of me-as-an-actor-in-the-world manifests as the broadening of the behavioral repertoire. In Figure 2 of Part 1 we noted that broadening the behavioral repertoire is more arduous and slower than making it narrowly more effective through mimicking behaviors of those more effective, healthy, or otherwise attractive individuals. But since the broadening contributes to co-creation capacity, it offers higher long-term benefits, and is a preferred choice for individuals who have learned to value co-creation. Valuing these benefits requires the development of co-creation’s basic strategy of discovering, and later using, the unconstrained natural behavior of self, others, and the wider habitat.</p>
<p>The shaping of a unique self occurs on the basis of shared or consensually adopted values, beliefs, and strategies to bootstrap self-development. Actualizing a unique self requires a shift in one’s perceived locus of causality (PLOC) from external (like social mimicry) to internal: “The more internalized a value or regulation, the more it is experienced as autonomous or as subjectively located closer to the self” (Ryan &amp; Connell, 1989, p. 750; Andringa, van den Bosch, &amp; Vlaskamp, 2013). It also manifests self-direction.</p>
<p>PLOC internalization is not so much a rejection of previous values, beliefs, and strategies, but a refinement of these by allowing individual experiences to be enriched and generalized. Hence, they can be applied more flexibly (less rigidly), more context-appropriately (i.e., more realistically), and more proactively with long-term benefits; this is a change from explicit rule following to the use of experience-based tacit knowledge and self-direction. The combined changes of PLOC from external to internal, from explicit to tacit knowledge use, and from group to individual authority, entail emerging self-direction and liberation from self-limiting constraints, adopted via social mimicry, that warrant characterization as a self-exploration crisis.</p>
<p>Identity research uses past or current self-exploration crises as tell-tale indicators of identity development. In this paper, we connect negotiating or avoiding this crisis to the development (or not) of co-creation adequacy. More precisely, a self-exploration crisis does not indicate co-creation adequacy, but only a co-creation preference; the individual notices its benefit over coping, but is not necessarily adequate yet. Similarly, we connect stable commitments to coping or co-creation adequacy, and the absence of stable commitments to inadequacy. Commitments remain unstable until adequacy is reached. Table 4 shows this for the four identity statuses we outlined above. (Berzonsky, 1989; Erickson 1966).</p>

<h2 id="identity-from-core-cognition">Identity from Core Cognition</h2>
<p>In the next four subsections we will derive the properties of the four identity statuses described in <em>Table 4</em>: achieved, moratorium, foreclosed, and diffusion. Our derivation is based on the framework described in Part 1, and in particular the four-pronged structure to deal with life’s challenges outlined in <em>Figure 3</em> and <em>Table 3</em>. As has been confirmed (Berzonsky, 1993), we assume no gender differences.</p>
<h3 id="identity-achieved">Identity Achieved</h3>
<p>An <em>achieved identity</em> signifies co-creation and coping adequacy: a rich and effective behavioral repertoire ensures that most problems are avoided, and problems that do occur are dealt with quickly and effectively so that co-creation can resume problem prevention. This involves the individual safely and effectively building on past efforts (<strong>stigmergy</strong>) that produce few unintended and adverse side effects. To the <em>achieved identity</em> the world is full of opportunities and solvable problems. And they can and do take responsibility for self-initiated actions.</p>
<p>Developmentally, the <em>achieved identity</em> emerges from a successfully negotiated self-exploration crisis that results in a well-explored stable identity and full self-direction. With the <em>achieved identity</em> comes the <em>informational identity style</em> that Beaumont and Pratt (2011, p. 174) summarize for achievers as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; they address identity-relevant issues by being skeptical of their self-views, questioning their assumptions and beliefs, and exploring and evaluating information that is relevant to their self-constructions [hence making and keeping their worldview in accordance with the state of the world]. The use of an informational style is positively associated with strategic planning [which includes problem prevention], vigilant decision making, and the use of proactive and problem-focused coping [indicating effective coping and co-creation]. The informational style is also associated with such personal and cognitive attributes as autonomy, openness to experience, introspectiveness, self-reflection, empathy, a high need for cognition, and a high level of cognitive complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These listed properties all facilitate high autonomy, strong self-development, and the effective real-world contributions characteristic of co-creation, as well as high well-being (Berzonsky &amp; Cieciuch, 2016) and wisdom, as we have defined them in Section 2. All in all, this expresses both coping and co-creation adequacy.</p>
<h3 id="identity-moratorium">Identity Moratorium</h3>
<p><em>Identity moratorium</em> develops due to a preference for co-creation and coping inadequacy: a (fairly) broad behavioral repertoire ensures that many problems are avoided, but problems which do occur are often not dealt with quickly and effectively; the individual cannot (yet) rely on stable and reliable strategies (commit) and instead struggles to develop these. To the person with a <em>moratorium identity</em>, the world is a place for continued self-exploration and major problems. He or she experiences an ongoing self-exploration crisis and has a self-development focus that, despite efforts, does not yet lead to a stable identity structure, although it expresses a “limited commitment” (Berzonsky &amp; Cieciuch, 2016) through its co-creation preference.</p>
<p>Although co-creation adequacy might not have been achieved, co-creation is still considered superior to coping and, hence, is the preferred strategy. This means that the person with a <em>moratorium identity</em> expresses the strengths of co-creation through a focus on contributing to a high-quality habitat, for which the person can take responsibility. However, the strengths of coping — control of problematic situations and effectively ending problems — are minimally expressed and might, when problem solving is structurally avoided, lead to toxic situations. This leads to less time for co-creating than the <em>achieved identity</em> status, and comfort, defined as an absence of apparent pressing problems, is highly valued.</p>
<p>People with a <em>moratorium identity</em> express many of the features of the informational identity style, but to a lesser degree due to their lower coping skills, which also leads to lower well-being than the <em>achieved identity</em> style (Berzonsky &amp; Cieciuch, 2016).</p>
<h3 id="identity-foreclosure">Identity Foreclosure</h3>
<p><em>Identity foreclosure</em> is the identity status that is central for the next section, so we elaborate it in this subsection. Identity foreclosure combines co-creation inadequacy with adequate coping. Co-creation inadequacy leads to structurally unprevented problems, but coping adequacy ensures that these are managed with effort — <em>i.e.,</em> controlled — so that they do not (usually) spin out of control. The concept of <strong>security</strong>, defined as threats brought and kept under control, describes this. The associated worldview is one of an unstable and dangerous world that needs constant surveillance, control, and the need for forceful efforts to prevent disintegration and becoming totally dysfunctional. This motivates the individual with a <em>foreclosed identity</em> more often than not (although limited meta-cognition ensures that they are unaware of this).</p>
<p><em>Identity foreclosure</em> corresponds to prevented (foreclosed) self-exploration through the uncritical adoption of consensual norms (Berzonsky, 1989; Marcia, 1966) and social mimicry. The dominance of the coping mode leads to favoring in-group level rules and, in general, shared (explicit) knowledge over individual (implicit) knowledge. Foreclosed individuals aim to adopt and express shared rules and narratives with great diligence, and they actively promote the adoption of their shared worldview. Neither the body of shared rules nor the single shared worldview is explored since it is adopted on the basis of superficial effectiveness and social mimicry rather than deliberation on its effectiveness and context appropriateness. The associated worldview is therefore often at odds with actual states of reality, thus perpetuating the body of unprevented problems that have to be controlled.</p>
<p>The resulting strict adherence to the norm and an insistence of oneness and sameness — generating an ingroup — effectively curtails agent and habitat diversity. This is considered moral and responsible behavior because it is intended to manage the threats that keep the coping mode activated. Ironically, “foreclosed” individuals see little value in co-creation’s preventative strategies and in questioning its associated assumptions and beliefs. Instead, they view them as <strong>out-groups</strong>: individuals who violate sameness and oneness, and hence, frustrate coordinated coping. This means that the “foreclosed” individual is blind to (superior) strategies that might structurally prevent the problems they try so hard to keep from spinning out of control. Hence, more often than not, the threats and problems persist, which locks this identity status into a self-perpetuated <strong>coping trap</strong>.</p>
<p>Groups of foreclosed individuals manifest a <strong>social level coping trap</strong> that, through their insistence on coordinating the behaviors of others, threatens to dominate the habitat. Groups of foreclosed individuals have the only identity status that insists on others changing and conforming. Their (unspoken) motto is: “We are right and you have to adapt your behavior to match ours.” They feel righteous because they have no access to perspectives and worldviews other than their own, and they lack the tools to judge the merits of out-group insights. Hence, they see only potential harm in out-group strategies.</p>
<p>Worse, they are particularly insensitive to arguments more nuanced or personal than rule-following and other forms of social mimicry. In fact, they prefer cognitive closure (Webster &amp; Kruglanski, 1994) in answering questions on a given topic, over continued uncertainty, confusion, and ambiguity. An even more profound formulation of their motto is: <em>“Out-group diversity, such as nuanced thoughts and self-directed behaviors, activates a sense of inadequacy in me, through raising doubt on my shared belief system. Diversity, therefore, must be suppressed.”</em></p>
<p>Individuals with a <em>foreclosed identity</em> express a particular form of information processing known as the normative identity style. We referred to this in an autonomy development context as cognition for control, order, and certainty (Andringa et al., 2015). The normative identity style is a form of information processing that latches onto the familiar, the standardized, the expected, and whatever has direct utility (McGilchrist, 2012). As such, it prefers representations that have been stripped of ambiguities and have been made fixed, uniform, invariant, and static. And in its problem-solving, it denies inconsistencies and instead latches on to a single, normabiding, in-group-promoting solution, and an associated narrative that has been coupled with totalitarianism and authoritarianism (Beaumont, 2008; Berzonsky, 1989). The normative identity style of the foreclosed identity has been summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Normative individuals more automatically internalize and conform to the standards and expectations of significant others. Discrepancies between information about how they are and their normative standards evoke feelings of guilt and concern about avoiding failure [to be a good in-group member]. Their primary aim is to defend and maintain existing self-views [to protect a shared worldview that promotes coordinated action]. (Berzonsky, 2008, pp 646)</p>
<p>Normative individuals report high levels of identity commitment as well as dispositional characteristics such as agreeableness, conscientiousness [both facilitating rule following], and extraversion [promoting the adoption of the shared rules]. However, they also report low levels of openness and introspectiveness [which forecloses further identity development], Normative individuals have been found to employ avoidant coping strategies, to procrastinate in the face of [individual] decisions, to have a high need for structure and a low tolerance for ambiguity, and to be conservative, authoritarian, and racist in their sociocultural views (Beaumont, 2009, p. 97)</p>
<p>Karen Stenner (2005) summarizes the foreclosed identity’s characteristic urge to reduce complexity as “Intolerance to diversity = Authoritarianism x normative fear level,” where authoritarianism is a measure of identity foreclosure. She describes <strong>normative threats</strong> as threats to oneness (shared authority) and sameness (shared values and rules). In particular, she lists questioned or questionable authorities and values, disrespect for leaders or leaders unworthy of respect, and lack of conformity with or consensus in group norms and beliefs (Stenner, 2009, p. 143): all correspond to a disintegration of oneness and sameness. This summarizes the existential threat felt by those with a foreclosed identity when their only strategy to secure well-being — behavioral diversity reduction through (imposed) limits on agency — is frustrated. But when they do not feel threatened, people with a foreclosed identity manifest intermediate levels of well-being (Berzonsky &amp; Cieciuch, 2016), since they are generally able to maintain problems and threats at manageable levels. All in all, this identity status expresses high coping adequacy and co-creation inadequacy.</p>
<h3 id="identity-diffusion">Identity Diffusion</h3>
<p>The fourth identity status is referred to as <em>identity diffusion</em> and is characterized by inadequate co-creation and inadequate coping. People with this status live in a world of unprevented and unsolvable problems, with dynamics that they do not comprehend, with rules they do not know how to apply skillfully, and where effort and hoped-for outcomes are only weakly related. Given their low adequacy, their well-being depends predominantly on environmental factors. For people with identity diffusion the world is unpredictable and often brutal despite the best of intentions. Hence, they procrastinate in the face of self-decision and will not take responsibility for their actions.</p>
<p><em>Identity diffusion</em> is characterized by prevented or avoided self-exploration in combination with a fluid or unstable self-identity. While aiming to improve their well-being, people with <em>identity diffusion</em> are often confronted with the consequences of their own inadequacy. Their intentions are good; their realization is not. And one often ends up in, or even self-perpetuates, low viability states. And without the benefit of self-exploration, they do not understand the causes of their problems. Much more than with the other identity statuses, people with identity diffusion live in a random (and brutal and unjust) world of problems in which they cannot take responsibility for their actions. This contrasts with achievers who live in a world of opportunities to be explored and responsibly realized. Beaumont and Pratt (2011, p. 174) describe the associated identity style thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A diffuse-avoidant identity style is associated with procrastination and attempts to evade identity conflicts and decisional situations as long as possible [all due to self-perceived inadequacy and mitigating efforts to prevent adverse outcomes and being exposed as inadequate]. &hellip; The use of a diffuse-avoidant style is characterized by low agreeableness, conscientiousness, introspectiveness, [complicating rule following] and cognitive complexity [indicating a shallow worldview], and high neuroticism. A diffuse-avoidant style is also associated with less adaptive cognitive and behavioral strategies, such as using avoidant coping strategies, engaging in task-irrelevant behaviors, expecting to fail, having a low feeling of mastery, and performing less strategic planning. [all indicating coping and co-creation inadequacy]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This description clearly demonstrates that people with a diffusion identity exhibit a narrow range of marginally effective or ineffective behavioral options that lock them into this status and curtail their well-being (Berzonsky &amp; Cieciuch, 2016). They express both coping and co-creation inadequacy. Nevertheless, self-development occurs, and they can, although later than others, adopt narrowly effective strategies (towards the <em>foreclosed identity</em> status), develop self-exploration abilities (towards the <em>identity moratorium</em> status), or both (towards the <em>achieved identity</em> status).</p>
<h2 id="psychology-from-core-cognition">Psychology from Core Cognition</h2>
<p>In Section 3, we have connected the four combinations of co-creation, coping, adequacy, and inadequacy to the four identity statuses. The psychological literature has derived the properties of these statuses and the associated information-processing styles via careful experimentation and observation (in particular the copious body of research by Berzonsky). But to our knowledge, we are the first to derive the structural properties of identity from first principles (in fact, this might be a first for any phenomenon in psychology). This provides evidence that human psychology is indeed rooted in the core cognition shared by all life.</p>
<p>We also suggest a phylogenetic scaffolding which has coping and co-creation (as essentials of core cognition) as the foundation; identity status and associated information-processing styles building on this; and then personality traits like the Big Five on top. This is not new; two personality meta-traits, referred to as plasticity and stability (DeYoung, Peterson, &amp; Higgins, 2002), have been proposed with a similar scaffolding model. More recently, DeYoung (2015) posited the underlying role of plasticity and stability in a cybernetic Big Five theory of <em>goal-directed</em> adaptive systems. This is similar to DeYoung’s proposal, although its goal-directedness suggests that it pertains predominantly to the coping mode.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>January 2013</p>
<p>Why does a researcher in the field of cognitive science and cognitive systems write a text about bureaucracy? Well, one of the main problems in cognitive systems research is that although we can develop robots and other systems that are able to solve particular problems intelligently, we consistently fail to develop robots that understand what they are doing. And not understanding what they are doing is a pretty good description of bureaucrats. Since the role of understanding is key to our field of science, I feel qualified to add a more cognitively founded analysis of the phenomenon of bureaucracy to existing accounts that tend to stem from the organizational or social sciences.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly this text concludes that bureaucracy is a pathological state of human organization, characterized by intelligence without understanding. Bureaucracy stems from the desperately embraced illusion, held by a particular subset of people, that human organizations can be approached as closed systems to be fully described in rational and formal terms. More specifically, this assumption is made by “superiors” who interpret the world either as filled with absolute truths or who believe that all knowledge outside the scope of their main competence is highly uncertain and therefore of little use. These “superiors” interpret any open world as too complex to handle – which it is true for them – and as such they consider complexity reduction the first priority of the organization. However they fail to acknowledge that this priority might be the result of their own limited or specialist understanding. As a result they do everything to bring the complexity of the organization down, even if this results in a mass destruction of the available competence and commitment.</p>
<p>It is this enforced attempt to complexity reduction that, if not curtailed, results in an organization in which co-workers are treated as and (effectively) reduced to robots devoid of understanding (replaced by procedure) and empathic involvement (replaced by blind obedience). In a bureaucracy the whole organization is treated more as a formal system (a computer program) than as an assembly of highly capable, willing, and autonomous individuals who contribute to the greater societal goal of the organization. This treatment is not only highly degrading towards the living, breathing, and feeling people who form the organization, but it is also deeply misguided, because we need pervasive understanding of the world at any part of the organization, otherwise the organization will degrade to mediocracy at best or a deeply corrupt and self-serving robotic zombie-entity at worst.</p>
<p>So the actual topic of this text is what happens if understanding, competence, and compassion are purged from an organization and the organization starts to consider itself as disconnected from the greater society from which it derives its existence. The result is, I argue, precisely the pattern that characterizes bureaucracy. This pattern will be contrasted to a non-bureaucratic approach that allows for the open character of human organizations and relies on autonomy, competence, and compassion, instead of rationality and imposed stultifying structure.</p>
<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
<p>This text consists of two parts. The first part is a summary of the main text in the form of two tables. The first table presents a comparison of the properties, signs, symptoms, phenomena, and other characteristics that constitute the bureaucratic as well as the nonbureaucratic syndrome. The second table is a list of red flags, also compiled from the main text, that are indicative of encroaching bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The main text forms the justification of the summary tables. It starts with dictionary definitions of bureaucracy and authority and the concepts of authoritarianism and its opposite self-directedness that refers to either an underdeveloped or well-developed ability to deal with real-world complexity. From this, we progress towards an analysis of the role of understanding and lack thereof in human organizations. This leads to an outline of the quite predictable progression towards more and more bureaucracy and the eventual mediocracy devoid of compassion.</p>
<p>This vision of mediocracy is contrasted with a description of how non-bureaucratic organizations function and what their telltale properties are. This opposition is used to address the question how to fight encroaching bureaucracy, which is not at all difficult in the early stages. The treatise ends with a description of the known epistemological stages and their properties that are highly predictive of the leader-style and whether the leadership will lead to more or less bureaucracy. Ultimately, it is a moral question whether one wants to stimulate or oppose bureaucracy: whether one is in favor of stultification or growth. The answer depends on one’s epistemological stage.</p>

<h1 id="bureaucracy">Bureaucracy</h1>
<p>The New Oxford Dictionary defines bureaucrat as:</p>
<p>An official in a government department, in particular one perceived as being concerned with procedural correctness at the expense of people’s needs.</p>
<p>It defines bureaucracy as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A system of government in which most of the important decisions are made by officials rather than by elected representatives;</li>
<li>a state or organization governed or managed according to such a system; • the officials in such a system, considered as a group or hierarchy;</li>
<li>excessively complicated administrative procedure, seen as characteristic of such a system.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dictionary definitions already point out some key features. Bureaucracies:</p>
<ul>
<li>are concerned with procedural correctness of excessively complex procedures</li>
<li>at the expense of addressing people’s needs,</li>
<li>they take over decisions from the places where they should be taken, and</li>
<li>it is a group or hierarchical phenomenon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course not all administrative structures are bureaucratic, and not all bureaucracies are in administration. And most ways in which people (and even bureaucrats) interact are not at all bureaucratic. In fact in situations without leaders, such as with friendships, even bureaucrats are not bureaucratic. It therefore makes sense to expect a particular kind of leadership as culprit. So the question is what makes some group of cooperating people bureaucratic? Or put differently, what type of cognitive phenomena explain this particular pattern of behavior? A suitable starting point is the strong, and disturbing, tendency of bureaucracies to take over authority from the places where it should reside.</p>
<h2 id="authority---the-capacity-to-control-environments">Authority - the capacity to control environments</h2>
<p>The New Oxford Dictionary defines ‘authority’ as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the power or right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience; a person or organization having power or control in a particular, typically political or administrative, sphere; the power to influence others, esp. because of one’s commanding manner or one’s recognized knowledge about something”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be clear that a bureaucracy touches on many of these points.</p>
<p>One way to understand the concept and role of authority is from creation myths. Especially in Western creation myths, the pre-creation state was either chaos or some unspecified void or nothingness. From this, an omnipotent being created the order in which lesser beings such as humans function. This Creator is the ultimate authority who not only created the living world, but who is also responsible to sustain and control the conditions in which humans flourish or wither. No wonder kings and emperors claim to derive their powers directly from a deity; and no wonder that those who have no idea how to self-maintain the conditions in which they function well believe it.</p>
<p>This defines a number of key properties of authority:</p>
<ul>
<li>authority masters both order and disorder better than the subordinates;</li>
<li>the authority controls and sustains the environment in which subordinates exists;</li>
<li>subordinates go to authorities for guidance and to solve problems they cannot solve themselves;</li>
<li>whenever a subordinate learns to take control over more and more of its environment, its dependence on authorities decreases and it claims more and more authority over its own situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties are keys to the concept of authority (and bureaucracy). It entails that whenever individuals do not know how to self-maintain proper living conditions, they rely on “authority” to keep living condition within manageable bounds. This need for authority scales inversely with the scope of inadequacy: the more pervasive the inadequacy, the greater the need for authority. Conversely, the better individuals cope with and maintain their own living environment the less they need authorities.</p>
<p>Within the domain of political psychology the first group is known as authoritarians and the second as libertarians (Stenner, 2005; 2009a; 2009b). Authoritarians prefer (centralized) group authority and uniformity, while libertarians prefer (decentralized) individual authority and diversity. Here we will refer to libertarians as <em>self-directors</em>.The predictability of authoritarian behavior has been studied in detail in “The Authoritarian Dynamic” (Stenner, 2005). Authoritarianism is characterized by a strong tendency of authoritarians to maximize oneness (via central control) and sameness (via common standards), especially in conditions where the things that make us one and the same—common authority, and shared values—appear to be under threat.</p>
<p>What follows is based on the scientific basis that culminated in Stenner’s work on political psychology, but here interpreted initially more generally – as coping with the ‘living environment’ – and later interpreted more narrowly – as coping with the ‘work environment’. For authoritarians, the need for authority is not an option: it is an existential need. Whether they hate or love their authorities is irrelevant: they depend essentially on authorities and obey their commands because the alternative — no one to maintain living conditions — is too horrible to contemplate. This entails also that authoritarians hate the idea that their authorities are untrustworthy or incompetent, which Stenner refers to as threats to the normative order, because this is experienced as an existential threat. Being structurally depending on others (i.e., authorities) is already suboptimal, and being dependent on authorities that are incompetent, don’t care about their wellbeing, or even abuse this dependence is highly unsettling. In fact, thoughts in this direction are avoided because it makes authoritarians feel even more inadequate than normal. This makes authoritarians about the worst possible judges of the authorities they depend on and align with. And it stabilizes bureaucratic organizations.</p>
<p><img src="/images/bureaucracy-status.png" alt="bureaucracy-status featured image" title="bureaucracy-status"></p>
<p>While authoritarians feel a pervasive (and generally subconscious) inadequacy to self maintain proper living conditions, self-directors are blissfully unaware of any problem. They feel – justified or not – in control of their environment. This also entails that when the situation deteriorates, self-directors find it normal to (re)take matters in their own hands. Authoritarians in the same situation will turn to their authorities for solutions which is less likely to yield results. self-directors might also be taxed beyond their coping capacity and from that moment they are more likely to adopt or accept authoritarian strategies. The reverse holds for authoritarians: when they experience a prolonged sense of control over their own situation they behave more self-directed. Crises and times or prosperity differ therefore in the prevalence of authoritarians and self-director personalities.</p>
<p>In what follows, bureaucracy is the authoritarian way to organize a professional environment. Organizations that are controlled by people in a self-directed mode, who by definition are able to self-maintain proper or even nearly optimal working conditions, will not be bureaucratic because they will keep the whole organization focused on its societal goals. However organizations controlled by authoritarians will gradually ignore the stated goals and replace them with more and more activities that serve another goal: namely minimization of feelings of (existential) inadequacy at every level of the organization.</p>
<p>To understand the dynamics of bureaucracy one needs to understand the roots of the concepts ‘authoritarian’ and ‘self-director’.</p>
<h1 id="authoritarians-vs-self-directors">Authoritarians vs self-directors</h1>
<p>Princeton researcher Karen Stenner (Stenner, 2005) used the following 5 two-option questions about child rearing values to determine the degree of authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Table 1: Child rearing qualities used to determine authoritarianism.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Authoritarian children should</th>
<th>Self-directing children should:</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>obey parents</td>
<td>be responsible for their actions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>have good manners</td>
<td>have good sense and sound judgment</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>be neat and clean</td>
<td>be interested in how and why things happen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>have respect for elders</td>
<td>think for themselves</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>follow the rules</td>
<td>follow their own conscience</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The difference between the answers that authoritarians and self-directors choose is qualitative: authoritarians teach their children to behave in certain proscribed ways and to obey authorities (elders, parents), self-directors teach their children to understand the world and act responsibly. The difference between authoritarians and self-directors is therefore neither ideological nor political: it depends exclusively on of the depth and pervasiveness of understanding of the habitat: not of conveniently isolated parts, but of the whole environment in all of its diverse complexity.</p>
<p>Authoritarians and self-directors may experience and interpret a shared world quite differently. If authoritarians experience the world as too complex the highest priority is to eliminate all sources of diversity to bring complexity down to manageable levels. And this, and only this, is the reason why bureaucrats take control over decision processes. It is not because they think they can do it better, but because of a strong unconscious urge to establish a measure of control over their world. And because they do not know how to do that independently, they turn to their authorities for ideologies, interpretations, and marching orders.</p>
<p>A problem here is that their limited understanding, in combination with the deeply unconscious nature of the root problem, precludes a proper assessment of the true sources of diversity and complexity that boggle their minds; they need their authorities to tell them why they feel inadequate, what the sources of their problems are, and how to cope with these<a href="https://corecognition.com/analyses/bureaucracy/#fn:1">1</a>. Which of course provides authorities ample room for manipulation. This is another example of the fact that authoritarians are the worst possible judges of their leaders. It is also a reason why so many “revolutions” realize the opposite of what they (cl)aim to realize.</p>
<p>For self-directors the complexity of the world is well below daily coping capacity and where authoritarians see problems they see opportunities. This is actually problematic because realizing these opportunities is bound to lead to a further social complexification that might aggravate authoritarians even further. self-directors are therefore, quite unwittingly, major sources of feelings of inadequacy in authoritarians.</p>
<p>And this leads to a one-sided resentment toward anything beyond coping capacity that authoritarians share with other authoritarians and of which self-directors are typically completely unaware. In fact encroaching bureaucracy can be interpreted as a (lowintensity) war between two ways of facing reality. While self-directors are unaware of any war being fought (especially because they do not understand the need for it), they can be blamed for co-creating a complex world surpassing authoritarian coping capabilities. Authoritarians, with their limited understanding, share a deep anxiety and are highly motivated to do something about it. This subconscious attitude towards the world makes them highly motivated to oppose all sources of complexity, unpredictability, novelty, and growth that complexify, confuse, and destabilize any ordered state of affairs.</p>
<p>Authoritarians do have and alternative strategy to deal with complexity: they can be educated their way out of dependence. This is a perfectly feasible strategy, but it is not a strategy that they will come up with among themselves (self-directors choose this strategy naturally). In practice it works only when their superiors and colleagues double as mentors who help to deepen and (especially) broaden their understanding of the world, allow them to experiment and make mistakes to learn from, coach them to see opportunities where they originally saw problems, and allow them more and more control over their living and working environment. This is the simple solution to prevent and counteract bureaucracy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, authoritarian superiors who feel threatened by subordinate independence will curtail any subordinate creativity and budding understanding. Selecting this kind of leaders in an organization is a sure (and time honored) strategy to foster bureaucracy.</p>
<h2 id="authoritarian---self-director-interactions">Authoritarian - self-director interactions</h2>
<p>Most research on authoritarianism has been aimed at the more extreme authoritarian and self-director personalities. However it make sense that most people shift in and out of authoritarian and self-director modes-of-being as function of whether the demands and the environmental complexity and diversity exceeds coping capacity and real-time understanding.</p>
<p>This leads to motivational differences: authoritarians, especially the ones with the shallowest understanding, are highly motivated to change the situation into one that is sufficiently purged of perceived sources of complexity; in society typically people who look different (ethnicity) or adhere to different norms (religious minorities, sexual orientation, and self-directors). Initially self-directors fail to see a complexity induced need for change and often allow authoritarian tendencies a free rein because they can deal with some additional curtailment (or additional complexity for that matter). While authoritarians are motivated and unified in their yearning for a less complex world, the self-directors enjoy their freedoms and add further complexity and diversity in the system in their efforts to realize their individual potential and enjoy their freedoms. Which of course bolsters the authoritarian determination to oppose this progressing ‘moral decline’.</p>
<p>self-directors only start to become upset when authoritarian curtailment of complexity effectively constrains their freedom. Initially they use their more pervasive understanding to reach goals in spite of an increasing self-serving environment. This of course increases complexity and diversity, with the stereotypical authoritarian response to further increase curtailment and uniformity. Typically only at a (too?) late stage they confront the red tape, incompetency, and self-serving character of the organization they have allowed or even helped to develop. This window of opportunity is an important reason why unnecessary bureaucracy can develop and become institutionalized.</p>
<h2 id="intelligence-versus-understanding">Intelligence versus understanding</h2>
<p>Intelligence is unrelated to the difference between authoritarians and self-directors. In Stenner’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Authoritarians are not endeavoring to avoid complex thinking so much as a complex world (Stenner, 2009a).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Authoritarians are just as intelligent as self-directors, and might value intelligence even higher than self-directors do. This is not because self-directors value intelligence and rationality less, but because they value understanding and creativity even more.</p>
<p>The authoritarian preference for intelligence is unsurprising because intelligence as measured by an IQ-test reflects one’s ability to produce expected and desired answers in response to problems formulated by others. IQ measures therefore intellectual compliance and conformity, which are typical authoritarian values. So it is to be expected that authoritarians judge a high IQ — as intellectual compliance — as highly desirable. However in complex times of change and uncertainty authoritarians judge behavioral compliance — obedience, even if it defies logic — as even more desirable.</p>
<p>Where intelligence leads to particular context-deprived standard solutions, understanding leads to situationally adapted, context-aware, unique solutions that are always in flux because they are in continual pursuit of optimality. With mere intelligence one can improve a bad situation to a standard situation (which may or may not be optimal), but mere intelligence is equally able to reduce excellence to the same standard situation. With understanding and situational optimization, it is possible to track optimality because it allows for a continual, broadly shared, autonomous optimization process. Without understanding, one cannot see nor evaluate, nor appreciate the opportunities for longterm optimization, which entails that the creative diversity necessary to remain excellent is interpreted as unnecessary and unwanted complexity.</p>
<h2 id="intelligence-without-understanding">Intelligence without understanding</h2>
<p>Authoritarians live, conform Table 1, in a world of which they understand many aspects only shallowly: they know the rules, protocols, and norms of normal behavior, they adhere to ideologies and religions, they know many examples of how to respond to particular situations, and know what to say and who to obey. But they have no pervasive understanding of why and how things happen and how the world is interconnected. In addition they are definitely unable to think and decide for themselves, follow their own conscience, and accept the responsibility for their own actions. Authoritarians obey their authorities and these are therefore responsible for their actions. This also entails that authoritarians cannot oversee the long- (or even mid-)term consequences of their own and other’s behavior and they offload the responsibility for that to their authorities. And if these have no idea about the long-term consequences or even if they have opposing goals than their stated goals, the authoritarian neither cares nor understands.</p>
<p>Our current educational system, which favors IQ and specialization over pervasive understanding, is conducive for the development of authoritarians. In fact it seems that Einstein was referring to the authoritarian disposition when he described the goals of education:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The development of general ability for independent thinking and judgment should always be placed foremost, not the acquisition of special knowledge. Otherwise he – with his specialized knowledge – more closely resembles a well-trained dog than a harmoniously developed person. Albert Einstein (1954)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The well-trained dog resemblance is a direct reference to intelligence — as intellectual compliance — resulting from specialist education without the benefits of the pervasive understanding that allows for independent thinking and judgment. The well-trained dog comparison is an effective analogy of authoritarians who exhibit desired behavior while neither understanding the larger context nor the consequences of their compliance. On top of that it is also the ideal personality type for the organizational ideal they envision.</p>
<h2 id="rationality-and-reality">Rationality and reality</h2>
<p>Rationality – the ability to think clearly, sensibly, and logically – is a valuable, but ultimately a limited ability: rational and logically sound thinking is only possible in a closed domain consisting of concepts that can be manipulated with logical operators. The key problem with rationality is that it is perfectly possible to be rational in knowledge domains devoid of factual reality. Bureaucracies have many ways to create phony realities that arise from many generations of documented and gradually more formalized accounts (i.e., redefined towards reduced complexity) of the impact of the real world on the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The formal response of the bureaucracy, for example the way it assigns funds and other forms of support to some activities while discontinuing other activities, is a very strong incentive to behave according to whatever the bureaucratic decision processes favor. This then leads rapidly to a bureaucratic “reality” in which behavior in compliance with the bureaucratic goals – whatever these are – is favored over behavior that actually realizes the societal goals of the organization. The rational thing to do is to behave according to the bureaucratic reality: and rationality is just as suitable for that, as it is for any other closed domain reasoning.</p>
<p>What the self-directed mode of being brings to organizations is a sense of reality; a structural grounding in the larger societal context that ultimately provides the reason d’être of the organization. Without dominant self-director influences, an organization looses track of its goals and turns into a – rationally and intelligently managed – activity that becomes increasingly self-serving: the internal dynamic, based on formal procedure, has become more important than the societal function of the organization.</p>
<h2 id="the-driving-forces-of-bureaucracy">The driving forces of bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Where intelligence and rationality are mainly concerned with local/specialized solutions and static and specific end-states (such as in an IQ-test), understanding and creativity are concerned with pervasive holistic optimization via novel and situationally appropriate approaches. These often non-standard and diverse solutions are typically well outside the scope of understanding and coping capacity of the true authoritarian and therefore highly suspect. This is the reason why authoritarian superiors hate (more) competent subordinates and generally do everything to curtail them. This underlies the gradual purging of competence in an encroaching bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The ‘intelligent ignoramuses’ —literally intelligent individuals who are ignorant— at key positions in an organization are the main driving forces of bureaucracy. This can be a functionary who is promoted to the level of incompetence (Peter’s Principle). But it can also be technocrats as the prototypical example of highly intelligent authoritarian specialist who lacks the benefits of pervasive understanding. For all domains in which technocrats are not competent they rely on shallow ideologies, sloganeering, minimal understanding of past events, caricatures and suspicion of complex phenomena, and especially on the wishes of the people or structures that have promoted them to their control positions. These technocrats are Einstein’s well-trained dogs that optimize, in all sincerity and without malice, a few aspect of the functioning of a complex organization, while destroying all other facets and peculiarities characteristic of the healthy organization that optimizes its organizational goals.</p>
<p>Especially in times of perceived thread and adversity, technocrats are, as all authoritarians, deeply anxious and deeply suspicious of any future situation that cannot be predicted or understood with their limited understanding. If pushed beyond their scope of understanding they have one, and only one, goal: the reduction of the complexity of the working (or living) environment to a (for them) manageable level. This goal can be reached via a range of strategies but is characteristically implemented through adherence to formal structures and the reduction of diversity in any way possible and as long as it does not require more than shallow understanding.</p>
<h2 id="the-spread-of-bureaucracy">The spread of bureaucracy</h2>
<p>This entails that technocrats focus on formal structures such as bodies of rules and regulations, detailed protocols (for standard situations), and shallowly interpreted best practices. True work floor competence and proven organizational excellence are an annoying obstacle in the simplification and uniformization of the organization ( a process often referred to as “harmonization”, a characteristic authoritarian reinterpretation of the meaning of the word ‘harmony’).</p>
<p>And because the authoritarian fear of a complex world is existential, the technocrat in charge is quite ruthless in simplifying the working environment: it is even seen as a good thing, because if (s)he with his/her intelligence and proven (specialist) competence does not understand his working environment, who can? Of course many do, but their attempts to communicate and convince the authoritarian leader are interpreted as subversive resistance against the good cause of simplification. Which justifies the activation of the bureaucratic bag-of-tricks for psychological warfare in which the now “harmonized” chain-of-command is used to crush subordinate dissent (and competence).</p>
<p>These tricks include promoting compliant friends (“team-players”) at key-positions and sidetracking competent others. Key information is increasingly kept among an authoritarian inner-circle and used to gain advantage over independent thinkers (who at this stage typically do not yet know they are under some sort of a coordinated attack). Promotions are easier made within the inner-circle, which entails a gradual, but quite effective spread of authoritarians at key-positions. In addition impossible deadlines are set and mind-numbing tasks are given to the competent resistance, and extensions of deadlines and other favors are only granted after acknowledging the power of the new bureaucratic realities.</p>
<p>This result inevitably in a fearful and demoralized formal organization that is devoid of its original shared purpose and enthusiasm and which relies more and more on shallow cognition: existing and potential subordinate competences are no longer appreciated and the organizational goals are sacrificed for the benefit of the perpetuation of incompetence. This of course increases the need for authority. And even when the authorities do a bad job, the incompetent and demoralized have no choice in accepting its rule, so the resulting cesspool of self-serving incompetence is surprisingly stable. It is also devoid of enthusiasm, passion, growth, and commitment.</p>
<p>There are strong parallels with the time-honored practice of slavery. Enslavement is not in the first place determined by physical constraints, it is primarily a state of mind in which one is kept incompetent to manage one’s living/working conditions. This entails that masters/superiors that value the stability of their relation to slaves/subordinates should prevent the development of a deeper and more pervasive understanding and with that the erosion of the need for authority. It will be clear that encroaching bureaucracy follows the dynamics of slavery, although unacknowledged because the bureaucrats in charge generally miss the understanding of what they are doing. And if they do, they do not really care because they do not see an alternative.</p>
<h2 id="mediocracy">Mediocracy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Mediocracy - a dominant class consisting of mediocre people, or a system in which mediocrity is rewarded (New Oxford Dictionary)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authoritarian need for structure and authority fosters hierarchy. Authoritarians crave a clear chain of command in which, without any need for justification, it is assumed that the higher levels of the hierarchy are sufficiently competent. This assumption does not need to be backed-up by facts or even to be partly true because the assumption of authority competence is an existential necessity for the authoritarian (as outlined above). The true authoritarian only needs an illusion of competent authority figures and this is another reason why bureaucracies become self-serving: as actual competences are suppressed (e.g., because the truly competent coworkers search for more rewarding opportunities elsewhere) it becomes essential to keep up appearances. In practice this eventually entails the disappearance of any form of accountability in the higher levels. It illustrates why it is so important to speak truth to power: without this critical function there is no way to stop encroaching bureaucracy/authoritarianism.</p>
<p>At the same time the higher levels in the hierarchy become increasingly intolerant of errors, because it reflects badly on the organization (i.e., the higher levels). All in all this entails that a once healthy organization becomes obsessed with preventing errors and changes from an organization that pursued its original function as well as possible into an organization that does not want to make (publicly known) mistakes. The typical instruments are Service Level Agreements that cover all standard services (that can be executed with minimal understanding) but that not even try to address non-default services (that require more understanding and commitment). In addition it is usually agreed that customer satisfaction of these services should at least be 7.5 out of 10 or so. Effectively this entails that service quality will improve if customer satisfaction is below this threshold and decreases if it surpasses it sufficiently. This is an example of mediocracy.</p>
<p>The organization in this state has now abolished even the pretense of excellence. However the remaining self-directors that do value the original goals of the organization will be forced to compensate for the mediocratic we-can-and-will-do-it-if-it-is-standardand-does-not-require-understanding attitude for everything that is really important to optimize. Of course self-directors can do this to some degree, but it leads to all kinds of parallel and unofficial structures where the required quality is realized despite the formal organization.</p>
<p>This holds in general: inevitable the rigidity and self-serving properties of the formal hierarchy lead to informal parallel structures to either realize above-average quality or to hide below-average performance. However these parallel structures are murky and easily corrupted. At best these result in a situation in which the functional hierarchy is quite different from the formal hierarchy. At worst it leads to a factual, never acknowledged, disintegration of the formal hierarchy into highly corrupt factions that use the formal hierarchy as a cover for and cover-up of self-serving activities. For example drug-running or black-mailing schemes by security forces, accepting or demanding bribes for favors and information by civil-servants, or sexual abuses among the clergy. These are all sure signs of institutionalized authoritarianism and the associated self-serving nature of bureaucracy.</p>
<h2 id="self-directed-organizations">Self-directed organizations</h2>
<p>Interestingly, self-directed organizations have similar unofficial structures as late-state authoritarian bureaucracies (without the corruption). This is not because of a formal choice, but simply because the idea that a formal structure can cover all necessary eventualities was an illusion in the first place: functional structures that contribute to realworld requirements need flexible access to the available competence and enthusiasm, without being bogged-down and interfered with by bureaucratic structures of mediocre competence that offer no discernible contribution towards meeting real-world needs.</p>
<p>Unlike authoritarian organizations that unsuccessfully try to reduce the complexity of the world to match the institutional understanding of it, self-directed organizations match the available competences and institutional understanding to whatever the world (justifiably so) demands of the organization. Where authoritarian organizations realize stasis and mediocracy, self-directed organizations realize personal growth, institutional excellence, and with that effective contributions to the wider society.</p>
<p>In non-bureaucratic organizations the formal hierarchy is as important as in a bureaucracy, but its role is quite different: it has to manage autonomy instead of enforcing compliance. However this is, for superiors in a self-directed mode, not at all demanding because the very autonomy and commitment of a healthy self-directed organization ensures that it can deal with stability (where efficiency and organizational optimization are priorities) and change (where protection of quality and the realization of opportunities are prominent).</p>
<h2 id="properties-of-non-bureaucratic-organizations">Properties of non-bureaucratic organizations</h2>
<ul>
<li>A “lived” vision of the goals and roles of the organization is widely shared. It allows everyone in the organization to contribute to its realization via wellformulated procedures and competent improvisation alike.</li>
<li>Focus on pervasive competence development; stimulate overlapping competences to ensure organizational redundancy, optimization opportunities, and more timely services.</li>
<li>Distribute responsibilities according to available competences, interests, ambitions, and enthusiasm.</li>
<li>Let co-workers organize their own work and make sure they have ample opportunities to volunteer for activities.</li>
<li>Be alert of indications of low competence, stagnated development, insensitivity to adverse consequences of (in)action, low inherent motivation, low commitment to the organization and the services it should provide (e.g., 9-to–5 mentality), and as early indicator lack of enthusiasm.</li>
<li>Approach the organization holistically: optimize everything in context of the whole; prevent at all cost strict compartmentalization of responsibilities and information, because specialism and other forms of close-mindedness are seeds of stagnation and corruption.</li>
<li>Allow for ample opportunities for unstructured information sharing. The Scottish proverb “When the heart is full the tongue will speak” will ensure that really important information will be shared.</li>
<li>Put real responsibility in every job description and allow a diversification or responsibilities as competence grows. Stimulate expertise, but prevent specialization.</li>
<li>Allow people to be enthusiastic about what they have done well and allow them to learn from mistakes.</li>
<li>Continually match organizational goals and individual growth. In healthy self-directed organizations everyone develops in terms of understanding. This entails that eventually many can “play” a diversity of formal and functional roles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically the only real requirement for a healthy self-directed organization is that everyone in the organization is at a position that does not exceed their understanding capacity: their epistemological development.</p>
<h2 id="epistemological-development">Epistemological development</h2>
<p>Epistemological development (van Rossum &amp; Hamer, 2010) is a highly predictable, although barely understood, process in which the first two stages, absolutism and multiplism are characteristic for authoritarians:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Absolutism</p>
<p>This is a worldview marked by dualism and certainty: knowledge is black or white, right or wrong, highly certain, composed of discrete facts, and handed down from authorities unquestioningly. Reasoned arguments to convince an absolutist leader are pointless, (s)he just follows authorities. You need to become an authority in the eyes of the absolutist to impose your views. And as long as you are the authority, you will have their devoted support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiplism</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a worldview characterized by the idea that one opinion is equally valid as any other, that knowledge is highly uncertain, and that there is no agreed-upon means for justification. And because of this there is no reason for a leader to take other opinions into account on the basis of their quality. However the multiplist leader is sensitive to arguments related to goal achievement: feasibility is more important than the desirability since the multiplist leader wants to uphold the illusion of competence, especially in the own eyes.</li>
<li>The further stages, that are probably only reached by a minority of university graduates, start with a position sometimes referred to as evaluativism and are characteristic for self-directors (and academics).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluativism</p>
<p>Marked by a growing realization that there are means of justification of various positions and that this enables an individual to assert some positions with confidence even if knowledge is evolving and contingent. The evaluativist leader is able to deal with uncertainty and balances arguments of varying quality, but generally only within a limited scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced understanding</p>
<p>Is characterized by the ability to evaluate a range of expertise and qualitatively different arguments, reconcile theory and evidence, provide support for a diversity of claims, and re-evaluate those claims in the light of new evidence. Leaders in these stages are able to reconcile the available resources with the organizational goals, while taking the full societal context into account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations that prefer excellence to mediocracy should be highly sensitive for signs of absolutist and multiplist leaders. All leaders in a hierarchy should understand the Peter Principle (employees tend to be promoted to their level of incompetence). Insufficiently competent leaders can function when tightly controlled by self-director superiors, but this is dangerous since the self-director superiors expect subordinate autonomy without the need of tight control. Fortunately, leaders with advanced levels of understanding will generally have no difficulty in shaping and maintaining a non-bureaucratic organization.</p>
<h2 id="opposing-encroaching-bureaucracy">Opposing encroaching bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Opposing encroaching bureaucracy in its early phases is especially simple when no one really wants more bureaucracy: simply score the current state of affairs and current plans of the organization in terms of their effect of purging competence (e.g., with the list at the beginning of this text) and start an open discussion based on arguments.</p>
<p>If a part of the leadership is absolutist or multiplist and simply refuses to accept any nonbureaucratic alternatives it is more difficult because arguments do not work, which is counterintuitive for self-directors and is likely to lead to a waste of their efforts. In this case a sufficient group of self-directors need to organize themselves to quickly organize more pressure on the absolutist or multiplist leadership in the form of naked power. The strategy is basically simple: offer two approaches; the carrot and the stick. The carrot involves a work floor derived face saving solution for the problems the leadership has, on conditions that do not enhance (or actually reduce) bureaucracy, while making clear this is 1) not negotiable and 2) already in progress. The stick involves refraining from taking any responsibility for any plans towards more bureaucracy through a combination of 1) actively boycotting the bureaucratic process and 2) making leadership failure as public as possible. The prospect of immanent public failure is highly motivating for authoritarians and it will be clear who the real authorities are in this situation (namely those who define the environment of the leaders).</p>
<p>However absolutist and multiplist leaders are no idiots, they are just as intelligent, and have many institutional tools at their disposal to demoralize their opposition. The most prevalent of these is probably the simplest: structurally ignoring, non-addressing, and ridiculing of the issues of those opposing bureaucratic tendencies. That the opposition is fighting to prevent or repair a pathologic organization is not understood and therefore irrelevant. The complexity reduction these leaders crave, justifies pretty much any strategy. This entails that the self-director opposition should act firmly and timely. They should realize that real authority shows itself as control over the environment (pretty much the only concept authoritarians grasp better than self-directors). So controlling the environment of the leaders is a key strategy. Put in more positive terms (that self-directors do understand): it is all about co-creating an environment in which every key process can flourish: even the leaders.</p>
<p>Opposing bureaucracy in its advanced stages is almost impossible from within the organization, because hardly anyone has any real competence and autonomy left. The result of any work-floor opposition in this stage yields generally not less bureaucracy, but a reorganization of inadequacy with little benefit for the public. In this case the organization needs highly competent self-director leadership that is well versed in the power play of highly intelligent and highly motivated apparatchiks. Fortunately, even in this situation bureaucracies can make a fairly quick turnaround because the gradual development of opportunities to (re)express and (re)develop individualism, autonomy, and competence are highly appreciated by many in even the most stultified and corrupt bureaucracies (as third world anti-corruption policies have demonstrated). However this should be a gradual process.</p>
<h2 id="ethical-wrap-up">Ethical wrap-up</h2>
<p>Bureaucracy, as interpreted here, is a pathological state of human organization that opposes some of the most central tendencies in human individuals: namely to growth, towards autonomy, and to the co-creation of a high quality living environment. Given the consequences, not opposing encroaching bureaucracy might be interpreted as highly unethical.</p>
<p>From an ethical point of view, educational organizations, and maybe even each individual educational program, should make a well-advertised choice whether they aim to produce the highly intelligent specialists – devoid of pervasive understanding – that Einstein compared to well-trained dogs. This will foster bureaucracy. Alternatively they may aim to educate harmoniously developed personalities, which requires a careful consideration of the development of the individual student and is, as such, a safeguard against bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Although bureaucracy is per definition focused on the working environment (in a broad sense), a society-wide degrading of understanding and competence is of course also facilitated if people are actively limited in their ability to contribute autonomously to the co-creation of their society. As such it is a serious danger facing democratic societies and it may lead even to society-wide bureaucracies that are only democratic in name because real democratic competences have been purged from society. In these societies citizens only participate in the façade of democracy and not in the population-wide coconstruction process that democracy is supposed to be.</p>

<p>In the years from 1991 to 1999, I contributed to the design and development of an applied cognitive science department – what has now become the department of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Groningen (the Netherlands). In that process we discussed the meaning of terms like ‘cognition’ and ‘intelligence’ extensively. As a physicist I am uncomfortable with ill-defined terms. But on the other hand, science is about discovery and the discovery of the meaning of terms is a worthy scientific pursuit. In fact, one might say that defining phenomena is the purpose of science.</p>
<p>For example, Galilei Galileo discovered a key property of gravity in that it accelerated light and heavy stones – dropped from the tower of Pisa – equally. Newton expanded this by formulating a law describing how masses – as the relevant property of the stones – attracted each other (accelerate towards each other) and that the magnitude of acceleration scaled with the inverse of the mass and the inverse square of the distance between the center of the masses. Einstein refined this picture by stating that in space, acceleration and gravity were indistinguishable. Which entailed that mass, space, time, energy, and gravity were intimately and mathematically related.</p>
<p>Galileo’s discoveries improved the computation of the trajectories of cannon balls. Newton’s law of gravity extended this to the trajectories of planets and it led to the discovery of new planets on the basis of minute perturbations of the orbits of the known ones. And Einstein’s general relativity predicted that even the trajectory of (massless) light would be be influenced by the Sun’s gravitational field. Newton’s formulation included Galileo’s formulation and Einstein’s included Newton’s. In fact, Einstein’s formulation connected gravity, mass, acceleration, time, space, the speed of light, and even energy. Hence it integrated much of known physics at the time.</p>

<p><em>Table: Progressive formulations of gravity include evermore phenomena</em></p>
<h2 id="natural-laws">Natural laws</h2>
<p>Einstein’s formulation of gravity is the result of the stepwise improvement of approximate theories that become evermore inclusive by elucidating, until then, obscured relations between phenomena. This increased the connectedness and pervasiveness of our understanding of (physical) reality. Although Einstein’s formulation survived 100 years of testing, it is likely that it will be superseded by even better and more general formulations that connect it to the quantum reality. And perhaps from there connect to an even deeper (information?) “reality”. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ovRZuv5Lo8&amp;t=2410s">the work of Erik Verlinde</a> for example.</p>
<p>What Galileo, Newton, Einstein, and countless other natural scientists did is to combine concepts, to ever-better and more parsimoniously describe the outcome of experiments (and other interactions with reality). An experiment is a question posed to reality: “If I set up these and these conditions, how does reality respond?” A well designed natural science experiment leads to a consistent (time- and place-invariant) response and the same outcome when conducted by others. A well-formulated theory allows a parsimonious and precise prediction of the outcome of many experiments. A valid theory of something allows us (and all of life) to predict our real-world interactions: it allows the mind-world to predict real-world outcomes. <a href="https://corecognition.com/analyses/inclusive-definitions/#fn:1">1</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Physical concepts are free creations of the human mind, and are not, however it may seem, uniquely determined by the external world. In our endeavour to understand reality we are somewhat like a man trying to understand the mechanism of a closed watch. He sees the face and the moving hands, even hears its ticking, but he has no way of opening the case. If he is ingenious he may form some picture of a mechanism which could be responsible for all the things he observes, but he may never be quite sure his picture is the only one which could explain his observations. He will never be able to compare his picture with the real mechanism and he cannot even imagine the possibility or the meaning of such a comparison. But he certainly believes that, as his knowledge increases, his picture of reality will become simpler and simpler and will explain a wider and wider range of his sensuous impressions. He may also believe in the existence of the ideal limit of knowledge and that it is approached by the human mind. He may call this ideal limit the objective truth.<br>
– Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-time-and-place-invariant-core-of-reality">The time and place invariant core of reality</h3>
<p>This is essential: well-designed experiments lead to results that can be predicted in the context of a proper theory. This not only defines much of science – as a way to ever-better predict the outcomes of our our interactions with reality – it also says something about reality itself: reality seems completely consistent with itself. It seems, and almost must be, internally consistent because every time we properly investigate an arbitrary aspect of it – do an experiment – we get consistent results.</p>
<p>Reality, in all its diverse manifestations, has a time and place invariant core that allows outcomes to be predicted if particular conditions are satisfied. Put differently: IF some real-world conditions are satisfied THEN some real-world outcome is guaranteed. A simple example is: IF you drop a stone THEN it accelerates until it meets resistance (hits the ground).</p>
<p>Mind-world IF-THEN combinations underly <em>intelligence</em>. Problem solving – the ability measured by IQ – is modelled by IF-THEN rules. And so-called cognitive models are build as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT-R">“production systems”</a> in which production-rules of the IF-THEN type “fire” when the IF-condition is met to produce a THEN-outcome. Suitable sequences of IF-THEN rules can be used to make a plan to change an undesired/problematic situation into a more desirable state where the problem is resolved or made irrelevant. This plan can then be executed in the real world, by carefully ensuring that in all steps 1) the conditions are satisfied and 2) the intended outcome is realized.</p>
<p>The same IF-THEN effect underlies the biochemistry of life. Life processes can only occur only IF particular conditions are satisfied. Cells create these conditions when particular life-functions need to be executed. The moment the conditions are set up correctly, THEN the outcome (e.g., some enzymatic reaction) is realized. Like with problem solving, the trick is setting up the conditions for desired outcomes. When the necessary conditions are met, a specific outcome is inevitable due to the time-invariance of reality.</p>
<p>This is also the way life remains alive. Life is a way of cheating death – at least for a while – through the selection of behaviors that promote survival and thriving. That selection process – and with it life – is possible, is rooted in the predictability (internal consistency and time-invariance) of reality. Life – all life – can to some degree predict outcomes of behavior in terms of positive and negative effects on self and habitat and uses these predictions to select behaviors that avoid negative (less viable) futures and promote more favorable futures. This is called <strong>adaptive behavior</strong>. The ability to <em>select</em> adaptive behavior – behavior promoting survival and thriving – is referred to as <strong>cognition</strong>.</p>
<p>And this is a definition of cognition that is more advanced and productive than the definitions we came up when we designed our cognitive science program.</p>
<h2 id="creating-inclusive-definitions">Creating inclusive definitions</h2>
<p>The purpose of this website is to play with concepts, their relatedness, and their real-world usefulness. Dictionary defines the words of a language in terms of the other words of the language. On its own, such a dictionary is completely self-referential: it is a little self-contained universe that has disconnected itself from reality because it only refers to itself. And still it allows its users to make more sense of structures of actual reality. Somehow the relations between the dictionary entries and their definitions and examples reflect the structures of actual reality in a helpful way.</p>
<p>This website aims to do something similar: to define scientific concepts associated with <em>core cognition</em> in terms of other concepts and then work towards something that is internally by and large consistent, while helping to make more sense of actual reality because the concept’s defining properties are grounded in reality and they can be tested through real-world interactions.</p>
<p>Taking the example of the progression of Galilei, Newton, and Einstein that gradually included and explained more and more physical phenomena – and improved their defining qualities – we try to do something similar for the domain of life and behavior.</p>
<p>That is why the reason we focus on ever more complet, precise, and consistent formulations of our <a href="https://corecognition.com/basics/cc-key-concepts/">key concepts</a> and ever more comprehensive and precise descriptions of our <a href="https://corecognition.com/basics/cc-two-ontologies/">two ontologies</a>.</p>

                <p>This section addresses two routes to social well-being. There are many routes to prospective well-being; in fact, all self-help literature and political, economic, or religious ideologies propose them. We have selected the “ontological security” framework and a recent formulation of “psychological safety” to represent very clear, actionable, and precisely-worded coping and co-creation alternative approaches to general well-being. In this section we will apply our core cognition framework as a metatheoretical lens to inspect the “theories” described below. This requires us to focus on the mindsets that spawned the theories behind either the coping or co-creation ontology.</p>
<p>Ontological security and psychological safety refer to seemingly similar, but essentially different, concepts of avoiding danger. We address that first.</p>
<h2 id="safety-versus-security">Safety versus Security</h2>
<p><strong>Safety</strong> is a situation or state with positive indicators of the <em>absence</em> of viability threats. It is a precondition for co-creation and for achieving and maintaining the higher levels of well-being. Adequately co-creating agents self-organize a shared habitat while minimizing tension and conflict and maximizing natural unconstrained behavior. Their co-creation adequacy prevents danger, harm, or injury because it allows agents to focus on restoration and growth.</p>
<p>In humans, the role of this absence of threats is exemplified by the difference between calm and boring sonic environments, <em>i.e.,</em> the presence or absence of audible safety (Andringa &amp; Lanser, 2013; Van den Bosch et al., 2013; van den Bosch et al., 2018). Similarly, squirrels infer safety from bird chatter (Lilly, Lucore, &amp; Tarvin, 2019). In addition, recent studies on how to improve the well-being of people with dementia (where reduced higher cognition opens a window to more basic processing) show marked reduction in problematic behavior by just reducing the prevalence of (unpleasant) sounds which are indicative of unsafety (Koster et al., submitted 2021).</p>
<p>While safety is a precondition for co-creation, security is the objective of coping. The Concise Oxford dictionary defines <strong>security</strong> as <em>“the state of being free from danger or threat.”</em> Here we sharpen this definition to “a state where viability-threats-to-self have been brought under control,” to stress its deliberate manifestation in coping. In our modern societies, increased coping prevalence is manifested by the changing role of the (national) security state from a sole focus on international war, to include policing domestic and foreign populations (Andreas, 2001; Raskin, 1976). It is no longer other states that are the problem, but our own domestic population represents a security threat to be controlled (Zedner, 2003). Similarly, organizations can both trust or distrust worker autonomy. Distrust of worker autonomy promotes coercive formalization of work as bureaucracy (Adler &amp; Borys, 1996; Andringa, 2015). These examples suggest that “greater security” does not necessarily signify “more safety.” It just indicates more coordinated behaviors and stricter control of potential (even imagined) threats.</p>
<p>“Security” and “safety” play central roles in the two attitudes towards the creation of well-being that we will discuss. Security provides actively maintained <strong>short-term</strong> sanctuary by controlling threats to viability and through enhancing control over diversity and complexity to promote oneness and sameness. It is a manifestation of coping, associated with the <em>foreclosed identity</em> status, and the normative identity style. In contrast, safety provides and creates environmental conditions conducive to <strong>long-term</strong> well-being through avoiding problems, actively signaling the absence of threats, and maintaining an environment for restoration, growth, and, in general, co-creation. It is associated with the <em>achieved identity</em> status and its informational identity style.</p>
<h2 id="ontological-security">Ontological security</h2>
<h3 id="the-origins-of-ontological-security">The Origins of Ontological Security</h3>
<p>Creating “security” is associated with reducing fear by excluding “the unknown” and controlling whatever activates feelings of inadequacy. An <strong>in-group</strong>, as a defining feature, shares common adequacy limits and aims to control the environment to make it more orderly, stable, structured, predictable, and therefore, less threatening to the in-group by imposing limits on agency via routines, norms, and rules. This method of creating well-being is defined by theorists in Sociology and International Relations as “ontological security,” and we interpret it here as a perfectly formulated attempt by individuals in the coping mode to improve their well-being. However, since it has the coping mode’s limitations, it can only improve low well-being to a situation of no symptoms. It cannot bring about the higher levels of well-being achievable by co-creation.</p>
<p>The concept of <strong>Ontological Security</strong> was popularized by Anthony Giddens who described it as the secure feeling an individual derives from attaining <em>“on the level of the unconscious and practical consciousness, ‘answers’ to fundamental existential questions</em> [<em>i.e</em>., problems] <em>which all human life in some way addresses”</em> (1991, p. 47). However, the origins of ontological security can be found in Laing’s <em>The Divided Self</em> (1960). For Laing, psychoanalysis is about helping the patient reconstruct his identity, or “way of being himself in his world,” so as to show no overt symptoms (Laing, 2010, p. 25). Laing states that individuals who have a “partial or almost complete absence” of this “person-in-the-world” theory are more likely to develop psychosis and schizophrenia (1960, p. 39). He describes such individuals thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His identity and autonomy are always in question. He may lack the experience of his own temporal continuity. He may not possess an overriding sense of personal consistency or cohesiveness. He may feel more insubstantial than substantial, and unable to assume that the stuff he is made of is genuine, good, valuable (Laing, 1960, p. 42).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Laing describes the diffusive identity status; inadequate, unskilled, with an underdeveloped self-theory, and with an inadequate behavior repertoire that is often ineffective, and potentially or progressively disconnected from the inner (self) and outer reality. He does not describe the other identity statuses because, as a mental health practitioner, his concern is with removing the <em>symptoms</em> of schizophrenia and psychosis. In the absence of a diagnosis, he has no tools to promote optimal mental health, or maximize human potential or self-actualization (Maslow, 1954). Hence, the concept of ontological security emerges exclusively from the logic of the coping mode, as its formulation and conceptualization are ignorant of co-creation.</p>
<p>Giddens (1991) provides a sociological interpretation of Laing’s insights, arguing that our identity and autonomy, and by extension our ontological security, depend on our ability to trust in social narratives and routines in which we are contextually embedded, and through which our identity is constituted. Adhering to norms and routines means individuals are not <em>“obsessively preoccupied with their contingent, and fragile nature”</em> (Rossdale, 2017, p. 371).</p>
<p>For Giddens the aim of gaining security is not to “accept” reality, or broaden and deepen adequacy by developing a richer self-theory through exploration of self and the world. Instead, its purpose is <em>“to create ontological reference points”</em> which simplify reality so that inadequate agents can deal with <em>“the contexts of day-to-day life”</em> (1991, p. 48) without learning and growth towards full self-actualization. In the terms laid out in <em>Figure 2</em> in Part 1, the aim is to make the behavioral repertoire more effective through social mimicry via the adoption of behaviors of (authoritative) others. It does not promote broadening the scope of behaviors. Hence it promotes both the normative identity style as much as it promotes authoritarianism.</p>
<h2 id="normative-threats-to-ontological-security">Normative Threats to Ontological Security</h2>
<p>According to Giddens, norms and routines which coordinate behavior, provide us a <em>“cognitive and emotional anchor”</em> from which (inadequate) individuals derive the “trust” (Giddens, 1991, p. 36) that continuity and stability will prevail in everyday relations, so that they are not confronted with their own inadequacy. Routines rely heavily on a complex body of shared knowledge, constituting a societal status quo that can be mimicked wholesale: taken-for-granted local practices, cultural narratives, institutional structures, and “common” knowledge (Berger &amp; Luckmann, 1991, p. 35). In other words, the status quo is the “<em>anchor”</em> from which security is derived. Ontological security is associated with (normative) individuals who have acquired a narrow but conditionally effective skill set for coping; they lack the behavioral breadth to deal with a world that is not under control of their in-group, and they feel an existential threat when so confronted.</p>
<p>This is a direct reference to Stenner’s book <em>The Authoritarian Dynamic</em> (2005) that we addressed in Section 3 on the <em>foreclosed identity</em> status, which predicts authoritarianism. Individuals with a foreclosed identity status respond with intolerance to diversity when confronted with normative threats, and hence they promote common authority (oneness) and shared values (sameness). The most threatening conditions to oneness and sameness “are questioned or questionable authorities and values, for example, disrespect for leaders or leaders unworthy of respect, and lack of conformity with or consensus in group norms and beliefs” (Stenner, 2009, p. 143).</p>
<p>Here, the normative “threat” to oneness and sameness concerns the condition of the self, more than of the perceived disturbance: “the self is unsure what to expect of the new: the exact boundary and inclusion or exclusion of the newcomer are not clear” (Chernobrov, 2016, p. 586). In general, the unfamiliar “new” exposes the individual’s inadequacy; uncertainties regarding the unfamiliar “hamper calculation and increase risk, jeopardize perceived or actual security, or signal indeterminacy and lack of meaning” (Chernobrov, 2016, p. 582). Consequently, security is concerned with maintaining one’s relationship with the environment as it is, via purging it of sources of uncertainty. This makes sense since inadequate agents are not equipped with the skills to understand or deal with the unknown outside of in-group-controlled environments. (See Part 1, Section 2 “Coping,” and the subsection on the foreclosed identity style)</p>
<h2 id="attempting-well-being-via-ontological-security">Attempting Well-being via Ontological Security</h2>
<p>The process of gaining ontological security is the process of becoming partially adequate via adoption of normative strategies (the mimicking of status quo behaviors) to minimize viability threats. As Mitzen (2006, p. 342) puts it, <em>“for theorists of ontological security, individual identity is formed and sustained through relationships”</em> with significant others, as is expected of people with the foreclosed identity status and the associated normative identity style (Berzonsky, 2008), who express the coping mode structurally and preferentially.</p>
<p>Berger and Luckmann (1991, p. 71) refer to the adoption of empowering routines and norms as “habitualization.” <strong>Habitualization</strong> is the consolidation of routines via reference to socially constructed symbols, myths, and heritage – shared knowledge – that sustain an in-group identity, which, in the words of Kinvall, provides <em>“a guide for future actions”</em> (2004, p. 756). Norms, rules, and routines impose in-group level limits on agency and reduce diversity (Rossdale, 2017), while increasing the probability of intended outcomes. All moves to achieve or retain ontological security enact limitations which restrain political critique and possibility, and securitizes subjectivity (Rossdale, 2017, p. 370). Interestingly, habitualization activates resistance in the form of the psychological phenomenon of <strong>reactance</strong>: the motivation to liberate oneself from limits on self-directed behaviors (Miron &amp; Brehm, 2006).</p>
<p>Individuals don’t only ascribe meaning to their own normative experience but are able to “<em>unite</em> […] <em>in a way that promotes order and predictability”</em> (Gergen, 2001, p. 18 in Skey, 2010). The resulting less complex environment no longer confronts inadequate individuals with their inadequacy because it is, for them, more manageable and predictable, and hence it appears and is appraised as less threatening. However, this complexity reduction also stipulates that security is achieved via adherence to the status quo at the expense of personal freedom, options for self-directed contributions (implementing authoritarianism), and diminished congruence with the actual state of reality. Inevitably, the façade of a less complex environment needs continual and effortful maintenance so as not to crumble in the face of reality. The weaker the façade appears, the stronger the normative threat, and the more frantically the façade is defended and diversity suppressed.</p>
<p>Any out-group identity is constructed via **othering, ** <em>“which denotes exclusionary and antagonistic differences”</em> (Rossdale, 2017, p. 374; Kinvall, 2004). Inadequate co-creators are only familiar with and comfortable in their own in-group context, so they construct the unfamiliar individual’s identity comparatively to their own, with a focus on difference rather than similarity (Skey, 2010), and exclude everything, even things of great value, when they fall outside the knowledge base of the in-group. This results in the construction of identities and routines as <em>“relative to other identity constructions''</em> (Kinvall, 2004, p. 762), making each in-group seemingly incompatible and inherently separate. By viewing each other as stereotyped members of a group relegated to a foreign status (Skey, 2010), they create <strong>out-groups</strong>. As the foreign is threatening to inadequate co-creators, out-groups perceived as “different” are almost always seen as a problem (threat-to-self). This process of othering leads to polarization, which traps the in-group deeper in the coping ontology.</p>
<p>The resulting security is short term because it relies on exerting continual control through the suppression of unwanted diversity (which exposes one’s inadequacies). <em>“The process of achieving (or seeking to achieve) ontological security frequently involves forms of exclusion and othering which may be both violent and counter-productive”</em> (Rossdale, 2016, p. 370). As there is only coping, there is zero-gain; <em>“Increasing ontological security for one person or group</em> […] <em>is thus likely to decrease security for those not included”</em> (Kinvall, 2004, p. 763). Routines and rules are advantageous to the in-group, as they stipulate order and increased predictability. However, members of the out-group are disadvantaged by these rules and, in turn, are threatened and feel insecure. In-groups provide the out-group with grievances: exclusion, suppression, supervision, et cetera. Silke (2008, p. 112) asserts that if <em>“marginalized groups are discriminated against or</em> […] <em>believe that there is discrimination, then there will always be sections within such communities who will be receptive to radical ideologies,”</em> thereby jeopardizing the security of the environment. <em>“Empirically and normatively</em> [ontological security] <em>push</em>[es] <em>us in the wrong direction”</em> (Nesbitt-Larking, 2016, p. 13).</p>
<p>Searching for security by relying on in-group norms and routine also can distract from real-world threats, and actually make the group less safe and effective. When speaking of the failure of commercial organizations such as Radio Shack, Blockbuster, or Kodak, Clark (2020) stated: “<em>These organizations were filled with large numbers of highly intelligent people, and yet they all fell prey to competitive threats that were hiding in plain sight. The countervailing strategies their competitors put in place were not mysterious. They were, in fact, obvious. What these organizations failed to do was challenge the status quo and disrupt themselves.</em> […] <em>They allowed the status quo to fossilize and would not allow themselves to change it.”</em> In other words, protecting the status quo might actually degrade one’s situation in a changing world. This is the fate of individuals existing exclusively under the coping mode’s limitations: it may postpone death, but it provides no guarantee for being or becoming well.</p>
<h2 id="pathological-normality-as-the-coping-modes-ideal-of-well-being">Pathological normality as the coping mode’s ideal of well-being</h2>
<p>What does the ideal of ontological security look like? It would be a symptomless perfect adaptation to a carefully controlled environment, protected from everything that might freak out the foreclosed personality. Aldous Huxley (1958), quoting Erich Fromm, noted that symptoms means conflict, which indicates</p>
<blockquote>
<p>that the forces of life which strive for integration and happiness are still fighting. The really hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. “Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does.” They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness.</p>
<p>These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted, still cherish “the illusion of individuality,” but in fact they have been to a great extent de-individualized. Their conformity is developing into something like uniformity. But “uniformity and freedom are incompatible. Uniformity and mental health are incompatible too … Man is not made to be an automaton, and if he becomes one, the basis for mental health is destroyed.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This corresponds with Maslow’s observations about the suppression of an essential human core, of which he says “even when its existence is denied, it never goes away, even in a sick person; and is constantly trying to get out. Discipline, deprivation, frustration, pain, and tragedy are necessary because these experiences foster and fulfill his inner nature” (Maslow, 1968, pp. 3-4). Maslow argued that <em>“psychologically speaking, that which designates a normal human being is in reality a psychopathology of the average. It depicts a lifestyle that is so widespread and nondramatic that we don’t even notice it ordinarily. In general, this normal life is one of general phoniness, illusion, and fear; showing that it is a sickness that is widely spread.”</em> (1968, p. 16).</p>
<p>Striving for ontological security then fosters a psychopathology of the average: a state of marginal well-being and psychological emptiness which is the best that coping can produce: it is <strong>pathological normality</strong>. Unfortunately, it is also what Hannah Arendt (1963) refers to as the “banality of evil” in her description of the normality of Eichmann who “would have had a bad conscience only if he had not done what he had been ordered to do.”</p>
<p>The question then is how to promote and achieve higher levels of well-being.</p>
<h2 id="psychological-safety">Psychological Safety</h2>
<p><strong>Psychological safety</strong> is a term that was first derived in teamwork research where it helped to predict which teams would work well and which would not. Psychological safety promotes interpersonal risk taking (Edmondson, 1999) and signifies a change from a defensive and self-protective team member to being a fully collaborating member without any motivation to self-protect.</p>
<p>Feeling safe is conditioned on positive <strong>indicators of safety</strong>. Safety is an outcome of successful previous behaviors (both coping and co-creation), and signifies that all is well. Therefore, safety signifies high adequacy, pervasive optimization (wisdom), inclusion, and <strong>wu wei</strong>. In such an environment, changes are attended to before they become pressing problems because in an inherently safe environment enough individuals have adequate skills to approach and adapt to the (natural dynamic of the) unfamiliar, without feeling threatened and defensive.</p>
<p>Whereas ontological security has a focus on maximizing environmental mastery through minimizing habitat complexity, <strong>psychological safety</strong> has a focus on maximizing agentic contributions in ways that benefit the whole. Via anthropological fieldwork conducted on organizations <em>“from every sector of society,”</em> Clark (2020) described the concept this way: Psychological safety is a condition in which you feel 1) included; 2) safe to learn; 3) safe to contribute; and 4) safe to challenge the status quo — all without fear of being embarrassed, marginalized, or punished in some way. Step four exemplifies interpersonal risk-taking most clearly.</p>
<p>Clark (2020) argued that the progression toward psychological safety is derived from the natural sequence of human needs; the pre-conditions required for co-creation to occur. Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (1943) has five stages (physiological, security, belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization) that correspond directly to Clark’s progression towards psychological safety. The most basic needs for Maslow are physiological: food, water, and shelter; these needs are not included in Clark’s psychological safety because it “is a postmaterialist need” (2020). Maslow’s next three stages (security, belongingness, and esteem) are the needs that Clark conceptualized as the three needs on which psychological safety depends. Psychological safety “is no less a human need than food or shelter,” since it is the manifestation of the need for agentic self-preservation, which has as much to do with “social and emotional needs as physical ones” (Clark, 2020). Once the basic needs of food, water, and shelter are met, psychological safety becomes a priority so that an individual’s maximum potential is unleashed; self-actualization and co-creation preconditions are satisfied.</p>
<h2 id="fours-steps-of-psychological-safety">Fours steps of psychological safety</h2>
<p>The first step for psychological safety is inclusion. The concept of inclusion underpins the difference between safety and security. When creating well-being via security, in-group membership is always conditional. In-group members feel unthreatened because of sameness and oneness: security derived by the suppression of diversity. When creating well-being via safety, membership in the community is <em>“based on the sole qualification that they possess flesh and blood”</em> (Clark, 2020) (which is easily generalized to include all living agents).</p>
<p>For <em>inclusion safety</em>, agents must be equipped with the skills to negotiate the unfamiliar by extending both respect and permission. By respect, Clark means the average level of esteem agents afford to each other; how much agents value and appreciate the unfamiliar. By permission, Clark means the degree to which the group allows the unfamiliar to influence them; that all, including newcomers, are permitted to participate as members of the community. Permission and respect are important affordances that agents grant one another in order to create an environment that provides safe passage for maximizing agentic potential and cultivating confidence, resilience, and independence (Clark, 2020). All in all, unconditional membership allows full access to the co-creation side of <em>Figures 2</em> and <em>3</em>.</p>
<p>The next level of safety is <em>learner safety</em>. Learner safety implies that you feel safe to participate, engage with the discovery process, ask questions, and make mistakes. The transition to learner safety means the agent faces the anxiety of the unknown (all signs of in-groupiness) and is not limited by it.</p>
<p>As individuals feel increasingly safe in a nurturing environment that offers respect and permission, we enter the stage of <em>contributor safety</em>. This is the stage where the individual is invited to participate as a full-fledged member of the community, and his/her esteem needs are fulfilled (Maslow, 1943). The agent’s contributions are successful; he feels adequate, skilled, and valuable. Hence, he gains self-esteem and, in turn, is increasingly respected by the community. Contributor safety emerges when the individual has acquired skills and is able to apply them adequately to produce shared benefits. The community has to provide both encouragement and appropriate autonomy to the agent (Clark, 2020). If the individual is hampered by discrimination, prevailing norms, internal bias, a lack of empathy, or general aloofness, he or she is denied contributor safety.</p>
<p>The final and crucial stage of psychological safety is <em>challenger safety</em>; an individual feels free to challenge the status quo without fear of retribution or reprisal (Clark, 2020). Challenger safety enables individuals to overcome the pressure to conform and, hence, can enlist themselves in co-creative processes; improvement, innovation, development, and hence communal growth (the more-than-zero-sum feature of co-creation).</p>
<p>While allowing and promoting challenger safety is a defining feature of psychological safety, challenges to the status quo are exactly what is to be suppressed from an (ontological) security perspective. Here the in-group’s focus is on protecting and defending the rules, routines, and norms that define the ingroup by suppressing diversity. Since ingroups feel inadequate under normative threats (challenges to sameness and oneness), any challenge is interpreted as an assault on precisely what constitutes the normative and authoritarian identity. And that is why suppressing diversity is incompatible with psychological safety.</p>
<p>Psychological safety is achieved via maximizing member contributions so that 1) members are equipped with the skills to confidently negotiate the unknown and unfamiliar; and 2) new and current members feel free to join, learn, contribute, and criticize freely, and, therefore, never harbor the motivation to threaten the well-being of the <strong>community</strong>. The result is a community or habitat presenting a high concentration of safety indicators in the form of unscripted contributions to the community. The progression towards psychological safety and fulfilling the natural sequence of human needs provides a recipe for co-creative well-being and growth.</p>
<h2 id="metatheoretical-considerations">Metatheoretical considerations</h2>
<p>The very formulation of the theory of ontological security shows that it is possible to formulate, with the best of intentions, a framework that is almost guaranteed to lead to a deeply pathological state of individual and societal non-development. Ideally this results in a situation of no symptoms, populated by individuals perfectly adapted to a world that is kept within the limits of their underdeveloped co-creation adequacy: pathological normality. Additionally, maintaining a world within tight constraints is arduous and wasteful compared with societal developing of the skills to deal with full real-world complexity, threats, and opportunities, as effective co-creation allows to be done.</p>
<p>Although this argument might be convincing for some, it is not acceptable for in-groups (<em>i.e.,</em> authoritarians), especially not for those under normative threats, who simply assume that out-groups must either comply with their in-group rules or be dealt with otherwise (eliminated, removed, or made irrelevant). Due to the absence of self-exploration and the associated lack of broadening of the behavioral repertoire towards co-creation adequacy, this means that the coping worldview is simply not rich enough to adequately assess its own limitations, let alone understand full human potential. Possibly, this also characterizes the formulators of ontological security, since they seem unaware of the existence of co-creation. The formulation of psychological safety, on the other hand, expresses co-creation very clearly, but it is concurrently aware of coping and its limitations because it straddles co-creation and coping skills.</p>
<p><img src="/images/well-being-pyramid.png" alt="well-being-pyramid"></p>
<p><em><em>Figure 4</em>. Well-being pyramid. The key transition is from conditional acceptance by ingroups to unconditional acceptance by a (diverse) community.<br></em></p>
<p>Clark’s (2020) description of the preconditions for psychological safety, in combination with the internal logic of the ontological security framework, inspired us to produce a metatheoretical summary (<em>Figure 4</em>) which builds on Maslow’s pyramid of needs (1943). The key transition in this well-being pyramid occurs between the lower level and access to self-directed growth towards self-actualization (Maslow, 1954). The transition occurs when coping strategies stop being dominant and co-creation takes over, while coping remains a valuable fallback to address pressing problems quickly and effectively. This corresponds to a change from in-groups that conditionally accept individuals – namely if and only if they accept the in-group worldview and, hence, direct and curtail their behaviors according to shared adequacy limits – to a community that offers unconditional <strong>acceptance</strong> to individuals and allows them to learn, contribute, and criticize. This makes the group diverse in its ability to solve problems and realize opportunities, and it offers ample context for individual and community growth. The transition also corresponds to a switch from “cognition for control, order, and certainty” (coping) to “cognition for exploration, disorder, and possibility” (co-creation) that we described in <em>Figure 2</em> of Andringa et al. (2013b).</p>

            <h2 class="post-headings blogging">5 - Conclusions</h2>
            <p>We derived two separate forms of cognition; coping: for addressing pressing problems and, hence, aimed at its termination; and co-creation: aimed at optimizing everything in the context of everything else and aimed at its perpetuation. </p>
          </a>
          <div style="display:none !important">
                <p>In this (long) two-part paper we aimed to derive central aspects of cognition from first principles and called the resulting framework core cognition. We summarized many of its key terms in <a href="https://corecognition.com/basics/conclusions/CC-Key-Concepts">Table 1</a>. We derived two separate forms of cognition; coping: for addressing pressing problems and, hence, aimed at its termination; and co-creation: aimed at optimizing everything in the context of everything else and aimed at its perpetuation. We claim that both strategies are essential; but it is the interplay of their strengths that, somewhat unexpectedly but logically, leads to the dominance of one of them: co-creation. Because we derive our conclusions from studying generic living agents, we claim that our results not only pertain to human well-being, but to well-being in general: well-being for all living beings, and by extension, for the biosphere.</p>
<p>The different purpose and character of coping and co-creation leads to two complementary ontologies of cognition that each follow their own internal logic and have separate key concepts. Coping expresses the cognition for survival and co-creation expresses cognition for flourishing. The differences in goals and internal logic of coping and co-creation entails that individuals who approach the world from these different logics do not understand each other at all. Coping and co-creation adequacy has to be learned from real-world interactions on top of innate abilities (to acquire these). But not everyone becomes adequate in both.</p>
<p>Section 3 showed that the four combinations of coping and co-creation adequacy or inadequacy underlie the structure of identity in humans and shed a new light on why the identity statuses have their characteristic properties and how this connects to how each status approaches information. In particular, the combination of adequate coping and inadequate co-creation leads to individuals who strive to control their environment – by promoting a single shared world-view and a single set of appropriate behaviors – to prevent it spinning out of the scope of their control, and hence exposing a narrow basis of adequacy. This is the authoritarian mindset as reflected by the foreclosed identity and its normative information processing style. Stenner’s (2005) authoritarian dynamic – intolerance to diversity equals the degree of authoritarianism times the normative threat level – follows directly from these properties.</p>
<p>In Section 4 we applied core cognition as a meta-theoretic tool. We concluded that striving to realize what is known in the literature as ‘ontological security’ is a precise expression of the coping mode’s (limited and doomed) capacity for well-being. In fact, we concluded that ontological security leads to a self-limiting form of well-being – pathological normality – that has been described as “<em>abnormal normality”</em> by Huxley (1958) and Fromm, and as <em>“the pathology of the average”</em> by Maslow (1968, p. 16). In contrast, Maslow’s understanding of well-being and self-actualization exemplifies co-creation. And we concluded that psychological safety provides the preconditions that maximize well-being and the <strong>healthy normality</strong> of developing coping and co-creation adequacy.</p>
<p>Already in 1973, Newell wondered about Psychology’s ability to produce wonderful scientific papers (Newell, 1973). He asked himself the question whether Psychology would have achieved <em>“a science of man”</em> at his assumed retirement age in 1992, or would another multi-decade period of paper production be necessary to <em>“home in on the essential structure of the mind.”</em> Newell concludes: <em>“I am worried that our efforts, even the excellent ones I see occurring here, will not add up”</em> (to the formulation of <em>“a science of man”</em>). He speculated: <em>“Maybe we are reaching the day of the theorist in psychology, much as it exists in other sciences such as physics. Then the task of putting things together falls to them and experimentalists can proceed their own way”</em> (Newell, 1973, pp 306)</p>
<p>Perhaps we have contributed a unifying perspective – by assuming core cognition shared by all of life – that helps make sense of the huge body of data that psychology has compiled. We hope we have and we will investigate this further by applying core cognition insights in diverse domains such as happiness and education research, separate brain systems such as dual type processing (Evans and Stanovich, 2013) the left &amp; right hemisphere (McGilchrist, 2012), the structure of values (Fontaine et al., 2008), and radicalization and extremism. Our hope is not to fragment knowledge and understanding any further, but to find more ways in which to unify the acquired body of evidence in a more manageable framework.</p>

            <h2 class="post-headings blogging">The Kruger-Dunning effect</h2>
            <p>What Kruger &amp; Dunning “discovered” is that people with low levels of domain competence tend to exhibit an equally low level of the metacognitive abilities to realize they are incompetent: they are “unskilled and unaware of it”. </p>
          </a>
          <div style="display:none !important">
                <p>In 1999, Justin Kruger and David Dunning wrote a paper called <em>“Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One’s Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments”.</em> They noted that “People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains”. Because of this they “reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices”. This makes sense: if you overestimate your abilities, at some point reality will prove you wrong and you will suffer unexpected and generally unfortunate consequences.</p>
<p>You may have wasted your own or other people’s time, but it may also entail that you seriously harm yourself or others.</p>
<p>What Kruger &amp; Dunning “discovered” is that people with low levels of domain competence tend to exhibit an equally low level of the metacognitive abilities to realize they are incompetent: they are “unskilled and unaware of it”. Hence, they judge their competence as adequate or good, while they are still pretty incompetent. While this is a unfortunate on an individual level, it may be disastrous on a societal level. Especially if policy makers, managers, and in general authorities, overestimate their abilities and remain completely unaware of this, even in the face of utterly failing policies. This lead to wasted resources at best and widespread harm and destruction at worst.</p>
<h2 id="progressing-to-mastery">Progressing to mastery</h2>
<p>The way the Kruger-Dunning effect manifests itself during learning is straightforward. When you do not know anything about a topic you rate your competence as low. Most knowledge acquisition starts – rapidly and without much effort – with the adoption of an informative and explanatory narrative from an authority figure. This is the first step of knowledge and skill acquisition. Initially you need to hear the narrative a few times, but soon you become proficient in the explanatory narrative: you know the narrative components and can predict what will come. This is also the moment that you can formulate the narrative independently, which gives a sense of mastery: you mastered the narrative, you can give the proper answers within the new knowledge domain, and you now have a basis of confidence.</p>
<p>At the same time you still lack insight in the real-world aspects of applying the just acquired knowledge. Lacking this insight, you are at <strong>peak confidence</strong>, you think the real-world application of your new (narrative level) knowledge is simple, straightforward, and even obvious.</p>
<p><img src="/images/kruger-dunning-effect.gif" alt="Kruger-Dunning effect" title="Kruger-Dunning effect"></p>
<p>The normal progression towards true mastery is to start applying your new knowledge and go through a discovery and skill-development phase associated with the real-world aspects of your newly acquired narrative. Here you discover that real-world mastery not only requires narrative mastery, but it forces you take the intricacies of reality into account. Strategies that appeared straightforward have unexpected consequences that you only gradually learn to deal with, and other strategies work only when executed with a skill level that requires considerable practice. You discover: “it is complicated”, your good intentions and contributions are no guarantee to produce outcomes you foresaw. In fact you might screw-up a few times, be corrected regularly, and even be ridiculed due to your incompetence and naiveté.</p>
<p>Rapidly your initial sense of competence deflates and you pass what is called the <strong>valley of despair</strong>. You think “It is not easy at all and I’ll never master this!”. Weirdly enough, this disillusionment with your narrative’s validity is a sure sign of your growing real-world competence since it signifies the gradual appreciation of the real-world aspects of the domain, and the gradual transition from “book knowledge” into skilled behavior. Once the real-world aspects are sufficiently mastered they can become ever-more self-initiated, and your self-guided interactions will work out as intended (mostly that is).</p>
<p>But, although your real-world mastery increases, your respect for the real-world intricacies remains. While you’re competence rises, so does your experience and appreciation with the efforts required to make it work as intended. High competence is always respectful. You might say “I’ll find a way to do it”, but you do not expect it to be effortless: it rarely is. And as multiple thinkers have observed, the more you know, the more you know what you do not know. This curtails your justified feeling of competence to levels well below you initial inflated explanatory narrative competence.</p>
<p>Individuals who developed many and diverse skill domains to the level of respectful competence, represent a lot of knowledge about the structures of reality and they have developed many subtle ways to guide reality in a desired direction. These high level skills (tacit knowledge) are neither easy to communicate, nor easily appreciated by the unskilled. In fact the higher the skill-level the easier it seems.</p>
<h2 id="remaining-at-peak-confidence">Remaining at peak confidence</h2>
<p>The previous assumed a true effort to progress to real-world mastery. But that process came with fairly high and prolonged self-confidence costs. Suppose now that your original self-esteem was pretty low and that narrative adoption and mastery inflated your confidence to really high levels. Will you allow your self-esteem to be returned to a level similar to your original sense of incompetence and inadequacy? Will you pass through the valley of despair in the hope of becoming truly competent?</p>
<p>Or will you protect your inflated sense of confidence? You have just mastered the adopted narrative to proficiency, you can explain it to others, you can say the proper things, think narrative-appropriate thoughts, and correct others if they don’t. As long as you do not progress towards real-world mastery you can remain on an island of self-esteem that is appropriately named <strong>‘Peak confidence’</strong>.</p>
<p>And you can do that by just preventing any application of your narrative in the real-world.</p>
<p>What will you do? Allow your first fragile and now inflated self-esteem to be lowered again or will you actively maintain the comfort of peak confidence? If you choose the latter you only have to make the explanatory narrative <strong>your ideology</strong> whilst preventing yourself from any real-world application of your narrative. You speak it and repeat it as often as you want, but since you never apply it you will never screw up, never be corrected, and never be ridiculed. You will not learn anything of value, but you will also be shielded from indications of your fallibility.</p>
<p>Maintaining peak confidence is alluringly easy. Even when applying your ideology – the explanatory narrative is now part of your identity – does not lead to the desired outcome it cannot be blamed on you, nor can it be the ideology itself that is flawed, your overly favorable views of your competence will convince you of this. And if it is neither you nor the ideology that is wrong, it must be the world; in particular those others that frustrate the expected real-world benefits of your ideology. These others are the problem: they create and maintain a world that frustrates the realization of the potential of your precious narrative. <em>You are correct and those others need to change.</em></p>
<p>If only they understood the world as you do! If only they adopted the ideology that you know so well and that made you feel competent! Why not spread your ideology actively and start proselytizing? The more people who adopt your ideology, the more it will bolster your convictions and the further your self-esteem will be raised. Others listened to you, they gained competence boost from your insights, they tell you how well you master your ideology. More and more they form a bubble around you that shields you from other explanatory narratives and the intricacies of applying it in the real world. The more effective your proselytizing, the less you will be exposed to people and situations that expose your lack of real-world competence. And the more comfortable and secure your island of self-esteem feels.</p>
<p>This sense of comfort is worth fighting for; if your sense of comfort deflates, so does your identity. Your low self-esteem will reappear with a vengeance, since you have not gained much real-world mastery other than through proselytizing a narrative without mastering the real-world skills to apply it. So, any dissenting voice, in particular anyone who confronts your ideology – the narrative on which your self-esteem depends; is an existential risk. These might expose you as an inadequate actor in the world that – deep down – you know you still are.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cos-of-learning.gif" alt="Cost of Learning" title="Cost of learning"></p>
<h2 id="defending-the-ideology">Defending the ideology</h2>
<p>Your self-esteem is now firmly dependent on the adoption of your ideology in your immediate environment, your in-group.</p>
<p>If you are confronted with a dissenting voice, your first tactic will be to convince the other with the best arguments your ideology can provide you with. If your narrative stems from the Bible you might talk about God’s love and commandments. If you are woke, you will discuss intersectionalism, white guilt, and patriarchy. If you adhere to a white nationalist narrative you will laud the benefits of the Arian race in comparison with other races and promote racial segregation and traditional values. If you espouse a socialist ideology you convince others of the oppression of workers by the capitalist class. And if you have adopted the vegan narrative you convince meat-eaters of their irresponsible behavior towards animal well-fare and energy use.</p>
<p>Whatever ideology you adhere to is ultimately irrelevant. Your explanatory narrative is the only one you are proficient in and have accepted both as truth an as replacement of real-world mastery. It is therefore true by default and hence infallible and complete: it is one totalizing perspective to explain all that needs explaining and all that can be explained. All your arguments stem from it and they are always sufficient and complete. And since you did not master other explanatory narratives, you are impervious to arguments that do directly relate to your ideology; you simply see no value in them. In fact you can only represent the arguments of others in relation to and limited by your ideology. This leads to straw man representations of the viewpoints of others that you then attack with the best arguments your explanatory narrative can produce.</p>
<p>And that feels good because you always win the argument. That you win the argument by attacking a straw man position that nobody actually holds is irrelevant, because the difference between your straw man and the actual position of others eludes you. What does not elude you is that you win all arguments. So if there was doubt left it disappears and you feel even more certain.</p>
<p>But how about those who do <em>not</em> argue with you, that just do not take you seriously or that remain unconvinced by your infallible argumentation: who do not accept the validity of your narrative and the authority of those that adhere to it? How to deal with these irritating people who refuse to see the light that you have seen?</p>
<p>Easy. You feel you are correct. And because you feel no doubt, you must be correct. And they are wrong, misguided, pitiable, and likely lost forever. You see no value in them and feel no need to protect them because of that. Quite on the contrary. The moment when you and your in-group gain sufficient social power you can deal with them by offering them a choice: adopt the ideology or be excluded or otherwise suppressed, made irrelevant or destroyed. You are a true authoritarian.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-happened">So what happened?</h2>
<p>You got trapped in the perfect closed world that the coping mode allows us to create. It self-maintains the illusion of perfection because it closes itself from the being confronted by its imperfections. Real-world influences that cannot be fit in the narrative world are rejected in favor of ever more elaborate narrative constructs that explain why the real-world can and should be discounted in favor of the narrative we keep repeating.</p>
<p>Instead of using your intelligence to ever-improve and generalize your understanding of the world, it does just the opposite: you used your intelligence to protect youself from any (sometimes painful) learning experience that reduces your inadequacy. The result is that your inadequacy becomes a central part of your identity. This fits with what we have written down in <a href="https://corecognition.com/basics/indentity/">part 3 of Coping &amp; Co-creation</a>.</p>
