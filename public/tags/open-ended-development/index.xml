      <description>A deeper look at self-actualization: what is it and what is it not? Authors: Tjeerd C. Andringa
This paper is about the highest form of mental health attainable: self-actualization. It is not a repetition of what Maslow has said about the topic. Quite on the contrary; it is a more or less independent derivation of the concept of complete mental health and full mental development that validates all Maslow&amp;rsquo;s insights while providing a scientific foundation.</description>
