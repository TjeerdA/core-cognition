      <description>Previously (Andringa, van den Bosch, &amp;amp; Wijermans, 2015) we have connected the existence of an individualâ€™s unique identity to the self-maintenance of the living state. Here we develop the structure of identity in terms of coping and co-creation adequacy. This leads to an enriched understanding of the interplay between coping and co-creation, and it demonstrates that the conceptual language of core cognition is a productive lens for approaching a well-studied psychological phenomenon.</description>
