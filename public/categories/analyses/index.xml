      <description>Mass formation from first principles In this presentation we derive the features of mass formation and the associated mass cognition from basic features of life. We do this from the theoretical perspective of core cognition: the hypothesized cognition shared by all of life.
Core cognition describes the basic requirements for the selection of situationally appropriate behavior. Selecting situationally appropriate behavior is what all living agents do, all the time.</description>

      <description>A deeper look at self-actualization: what is it and what is it not? Authors: Tjeerd C. Andringa
This paper is about the highest form of mental health attainable: self-actualization. It is not a repetition of what Maslow has said about the topic. Quite on the contrary; it is a more or less independent derivation of the concept of complete mental health and full mental development that validates all Maslow&amp;rsquo;s insights while providing a scientific foundation.</description>
