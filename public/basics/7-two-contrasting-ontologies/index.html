<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><strong>Ontology of survival (coping)</strong></th>
<th><strong>Ontology of thriving (co-creation)</strong></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Languishing</td>
<td>Low viability state as the outcome of a pattern of ineffective or misguided behaviors</td>
<td>High viability state as the outcome of a pattern of broadly effective behaviors</td>
<td>Flourishing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Threat: behavioral constraints</td>
<td>Agent appraisal of viability threats, entailing a reduction of the set of context appropriate behavioral options to include only those that allow the agent to survive</td>
<td>Agent appraisal of the absence of viability threats, allowing self-guided exploration of opportunities that enlarge the set of context appropriate behavioral options</td>
<td>Safety: behavioral freedom</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Problem</td>
<td>A perceived threat to agent viability that activates a pressing need and hence motivates reactive behavior</td>
<td>A perceived possibility to improve (agent or habitat) viability and hence motivates proactive behavior and the expression of novel behaviors</td>
<td>Opportunity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Coping</td>
<td>The reactive fallback mode of behavior aimed at protecting agent viability by ending problem states. Quick and effective deactivation of coping is the measure of success of the coping mode</td>
<td>The pro-active default mode of behavior aimed at producing indirect viability benefits through habitat contributions that improve the conditions for future agentic existence</td>
<td>Co-creation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reactive behavior</td>
<td>Behavior in response to perceived threats to viability</td>
<td>Behavior aimed at setting up or protecting the conditions for co-creation</td>
<td>Proactive behavior</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Coping trap (Coping failure)</td>
<td>The continual or predominant activation of the coping mode of behavior through ineffective or counterproductive problem-solving strategies.</td>
<td>Prolonged or near continual activation of co-creation.</td>
<td>Successful co-creation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Targeted optimization</td>
<td>Goal oriented behaviors such as problem solving and task execution</td>
<td>Optimize the whole of agentic existence, while addressing selfish needs and creating ever better conditions for agentic life.</td>
<td>Pervasive optimization</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Social mimicry</td>
<td>The adoption of behaviors of effective, healthy, or otherwise attractive agents leading to sameness and oneness</td>
<td>Skilled contribution of self-deciding individuals that adapt and use opportunities to promote habitat flourishing</td>
<td>Responsible autonomy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Learning to become less ineffective</td>
<td>Mimicry based learning, where behaviors of effective, healthy, or otherwise attractive agents are copied and expressed and hence manifest shared knowledge</td>
<td>The adoption of new behaviors via interactive engagement with different environments. Manifested as tacit knowledge</td>
<td>Learning as extending the behavioral repertoire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Main mode of cognition: Intelligence</td>
<td>The ability to solve problems and fulfill goal oriented tasks (to end states of pressing needs)</td>
<td>The ability to avoid problems and co-create: (Also: The balancing skills to contribute to the biosphere)</td>
<td>Main mode of cognition: Generalized wisdom</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Inadequacy</td>
<td>The tendency to self-create, prolong, or worsen problems that keep on activating the coping mode. An inadequate agent is predominantly coping, but unsuccessful in ending the activators of coping.</td>
<td>The skill to avoid problems or end them quickly so that coping is rare and co-creation prevalent. An adequate agent is a predominant co-creator</td>
<td>Adequacy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Coping adequacy</td>
<td>The skill to solve pressing problems (ending the need to cope) or mitigate their impact through control of the environment and constraining agency (continuing coping)</td>
<td>The skill to avoid and end problems through harmonizing relations, (inter-agent) conflict mitigation, and promoting unconstrained innate behaviors</td>
<td>Co-creation adequacy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In-group</td>
<td>A group of individuals sharing similar limits on adequacy (and worldview)</td>
<td>A group of individuals that each freely and self-guided contribute whatever benefit their adequacy offers</td>
<td>Community</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out-group</td>
<td>Individuals who violate sameness and oneness and hence frustrate coordinated coping</td>
<td>See above</td>
<td>See above</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Security</td>
<td>A situation or state where viability threats-to-self are brought under control</td>
<td>A situation or state with positive indicators of the absence of viability threats</td>
<td>Safety</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Power</td>
<td>The ability to realize intended outcomes by effortfully shaping and controlling the habitat and the activities of the agents that comprise it. Exercising power is a way to be authoritative.</td>
<td>Effortless action expressing authority through harmonizing a diversity of agentic interests by promoting natural agentic dynamics and development.</td>
<td>Wu wei</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Security</td>
<td>A situation or state where viability threats-to-self are brought under control</td>
<td>A situation or state with positive indicators of the absence of viability threats</td>
<td>Safety</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Well-being - short term</td>
<td>Self-evaluation of one’s agentic viability</td>
<td>Holistic self-valuation of one’s own and the habitat’s viability</td>
<td>Well-being - long term</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ontological security</td>
<td>The secure feeling an individual derives from attaining “on the level of the unconscious and practical consciousness, ‘answers’ to fundamental existential [problems] which all human life in some way addresses” (Giddens, 1991)</td>
<td>Self-realizing one’s full individual potential</td>
<td>Self-actualization</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rules of ontological security</td>
<td>I am accepted when I contribute to sameness and oneness<br/> I learn rules and routines of my in-group<br/>I adhere to in-group roles <br/>I protect the in-group against unmanageable diversity</td>
<td>I can join freely <br>I can learn <br>freely I can contribute freely<br> I can criticize freely</td>
<td>Rules of psychological safety</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Habitualization</td>
<td>The consolidation of routines via reference to socially constructed rules and routines, sustaining a group identity and the security on derives from in-group membership.</td>
<td>The motivation to liberate oneself from imposed limits on self-guided behavior and the restoration of the safety associated with co-creative processes.</td>
<td>Reactance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In-group</td>
<td>A group of individuals sharing similar limits on adequacy (and worldview)</td>
<td>A group of individuals that each freely and self-guided contribute whatever benefit their adequacy can bring.</td>
<td>Community</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Out-group</td>
<td>Individuals who are not in-group and hence frustrate coordinated coping</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Othering</td>
<td>The process of assigning individuals with other or less limits to adequacy to out-groups (possibly disgust driven)</td>
<td>Unconditional acceptance</td>
<td>Acceptance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pathological normality</td>
<td>Complete and symptomless adaptation to a world shaped through coping that imposes limits on individual agency and self-development</td>
<td>The ability to co-create and cope in the service of full self-development</td>
<td>Healthy normality</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Normative threat</td>
<td>Threats to oneness (shared authority) and sameness (shared values and rules)</td>
<td>Perceivable indications of other agents engaged in unforced activities.</td>
<td>Indicators of safety</td>
</tr>
