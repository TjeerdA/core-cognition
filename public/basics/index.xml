      <description>What is core cognition? Core Cognition is the cognition shared by all of life. Core Cognition describes the basic decision making structures that allowed living agents to grow a biosphere from small and fragile to extensive, robust, incredibly diverse, and highly efficient. Core cognition describes the processes of behavior selection for survival and thriving, which is something that is relevant for all of living individuals: from bacteria to humans. But cognition for flourishing – coping – is essentially different from the cognition for survival – co-creation.</description>

      <description>Introduction This 4 section series is based on a recent paper (Andringa &amp;amp; Denham, 2021) in which we outline the basics of core cognition starting from the demands to being and remaining alive and maximizing viability of self and habitat. In it we derive core cognition and its two main modes, coping and co-creation, from first principles.
This page pertains to living agents in general.

      <title>2 - Coping and Co-creation</title>

      <description>Section 2 - Coping and co-creation This section addresses the quite different and complementary features of coping and co-creation. We need both, because successful coping maximizes time for co-creation. The complementarity of the two modes, as two separate ontologies that disagree on many aspects, might be the root of life’s resilience. Where resilience is defined as “the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks” (Walker et al.</description>

      <title>3 - Identity as coping and co-creation (in)adequacy</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/basics/3-identity-as-coping-and-co-creation-in-adequacy/</link>

      <description>Previously (Andringa, van den Bosch, &amp;amp; Wijermans, 2015) we have connected the existence of an individual’s unique identity to the self-maintenance of the living state. Here we develop the structure of identity in terms of coping and co-creation adequacy. This leads to an enriched understanding of the interplay between coping and co-creation, and it demonstrates that the conceptual language of core cognition is a productive lens for approaching a well-studied psychological phenomenon.</description>

      <title>4 - Two routes to general well being</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/basics/4-two-routes-to-general-well-being/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/basics/4-two-routes-to-general-well-being/</guid>
      <description>This section addresses two routes to social well-being. There are many routes to prospective well-being; in fact, all self-help literature and political, economic, or religious ideologies propose them. We have selected the “ontological security” framework and a recent formulation of “psychological safety” to represent very clear, actionable, and precisely-worded coping and co-creation alternative approaches to general well-being. In this section we will apply our core cognition framework as a metatheoretical lens to inspect the “theories” described below.</description>

      <title>5 - Conclusions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/basics/5-conclusions/</link>

      <description>In this (long) two-part paper we aimed to derive central aspects of cognition from first principles and called the resulting framework core cognition. We summarized many of its key terms in Table 1. We derived two separate forms of cognition; coping: for addressing pressing problems and, hence, aimed at its termination; and co-creation: aimed at optimizing everything in the context of everything else and aimed at its perpetuation. We claim that both strategies are essential; but it is the interplay of their strengths that, somewhat unexpectedly but logically, leads to the dominance of one of them: co-creation.</description>

      <title>Two contrasting ontologies</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/basics/7-two-contrasting-ontologies/</link>

      <description>This is a table with two contrasting self-consistent ontologies that arise from the defining properties of coping and co-creation. It complements the key concept table Ideally the ontology of thriving dominates with continual focused contributions of the ontology of survival. But it is also possible that coping starts to dominate to the exclusion of the other ontology: a coping trap
    Ontology of survival (coping) Ontology of thriving (co-creation)      Languishing Low viability state as the outcome of a pattern of ineffective or misguided behaviors High viability state as the outcome of a pattern of broadly effective behaviors Flourishing   Threat: behavioral constraints Agent appraisal of viability threats, entailing a reduction of the set of context appropriate behavioral options to include only those that allow the agent to survive Agent appraisal of the absence of viability threats, allowing self-guided exploration of opportunities that enlarge the set of context appropriate behavioral options Safety: behavioral freedom   Problem A perceived threat to agent viability that activates a pressing need and hence motivates reactive behavior A perceived possibility to improve (agent or habitat) viability and hence motivates proactive behavior and the expression of novel behaviors Opportunity   Coping The reactive fallback mode of behavior aimed at protecting agent viability by ending problem states.</description>
