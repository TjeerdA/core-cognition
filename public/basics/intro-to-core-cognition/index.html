          <h3 id="what-is-core-cognition">What is core cognition?</h3>
<p>Core Cognition is the cognition shared by all of life. Core Cognition describes the basic decision making structures that allowed living agents to grow a biosphere from small and fragile to extensive, robust, incredibly diverse, and highly efficient. Core cognition describes the processes of behavior selection for <strong>survival</strong> and <strong>thriving</strong>, which is something that is relevant for all of living individuals: from bacteria to humans. But cognition for flourishing – coping – is essentially different from the cognition for survival – co-creation. This website addressed the power and consequences of this basic idea and we argue that also human cognition (psychology) manifests core cognition in all its key properties.</p>

</table>
<p><em>Table: Key differences between coping and co-creation</em></p>
<p>One way of summarizing these differences is that coping assumes a closed world: all agentic efforts are focused on the perceived problem or threat and a solution space (umwelt) is created that is just big enough to allow the individual to deal with the problem in the least risky and most effective (but not necessarily best) way known to the agent.</p>
<p>In contrast, co-creation assumes an open world: a world in which everything has a potential influence on everything else and where infinitely many ways exist to prevent future problems and equally many ways exist to build on the traces previous behaviors left in the environment. The associated Umwelt is effectively unlimited here. This is the mode that can optimize everything in the context of everything else, where the sheer infinite set of possible contributions entail the freedom to act in ways that come easy.</p>
<p>Coping feels forced because it is activated  by problems and threats and behaviors must be selected reactively from a small set to avoid harm or death. There is always a degree of urgency and an experience of being compelled to respond rather than being fully free to self-decide. Co-creation feels unforced since is allowed by the absence of threats and pressing needs, which allows behaviors to be experienced as unforced, truly self-selected, and Bradly beneficial.</p>
<p>Core cognition intends to become the theoretical framework that explains many features of our daily experience and interactions with the world. In particular it allows the develop or improve an outsiders perspective on your own daily functioning in a complex social and natural world.</p>

    <p>This 4 section series is based on a recent paper (Andringa &amp; Denham, 2021) in which we outline the basics of core cognition starting from the demands to being and remaining alive and maximizing viability of self and habitat. In it we derive core cognition and its two main modes, coping and co-creation, from first principles.</p>

    <p>Here we develop the <strong>structure of identity</strong> in terms of coping and co-creation adequacy. This leads to an enriched understanding of the interplay between coping and co-creation, and it demonstrates that the conceptual language of core cognition is a productive lens for approaching a well-studied psychological phenomenon.</p>

    <p>This section addresses two routes to social well-being. There are many routes to prospective well-being; in fact, all self-help literature and political, economic, or religious ideologies propose them. We have selected the “ontological security” framework and a recent formulation of “psychological safety” to represent very clear, actionable, and precisely-worded coping and co-creation alternative approaches to general well-being.</p>
